        " About John Neff  : While known as the manager with whom many top managers entrusted their own money, Neff was far from the smooth-talking, high-profile Wall Streeter you might expect. He was mild-mannered and low-key, and the same might be said of the Windsor Fund that he managed for more than three decades. In fact, Neff himself described the fund as \"relatively prosaic, dull, [and] conservative.\" There was nothing dull about his results, however. From 1964 to 1995, Neff guided Windsor to a 13.7 percent average annual return, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return during that time. That 3.1 percentage point difference is huge over time -- a $10,000 investment in Windsor (with dividends reinvested) at the start of Neff's tenure would have ended up as more than $564,000 by the time he retired, more than twice what the same investment in the S&P would have yielded (about $233,000). Considering the length of his tenure, that track record may be the best ever for a manager of such a large fund.",

      "title": "Is ABB Finally in Turnaround Mode? - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "Value investors will be looking at ABB (NYSE: ABB) for a number of reasons, not least of which is its eye-catching forward dividend yield of 4.3%. Throw in the argument that the company's significant restructuring initiatives could lead to substantive performance improvement relative to its peers, and the case gets even stronger.",
        "ABB is definitely a turnaround story, but is it buy? And what do you need to know before buying the stock? Let's take a look in the light of the recent results.",
        "Going back to 2016, activist hedge fund Cevian Capital pushed ABB to separate its poorly performing power-grids division, leaving it to focus on automation, robotics, and motion. Management's response in early 2017? Keep power grids but invest in internal development and acquisitions in order to digitalize products. Clearly, ABB's management believed software and digitalization were the way to go.",
        "Image source: Getty Images.",
        "Move ahead to the end of 2018, and the announcement that ABB would be selling the power-grids division to Hitachi for $11 billion. But two things stayed consistent. First, Ulrich Spiesshofer, the CEO at the time, continued to invest in digital technologies\u00a0by forming a partnerships such as that with Dassault Systemes to develop digital-twin solutions or with Microsoft to support ABB's industrial internet of things (IIoT) platform.",
        "Second, the company's margin performance continued to lag just about any peer or rival you could think of.",
        "ABB EBITDA Margin data by YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months.",
        "Not content with merely selling its power grids division, ABB announced it would restructure into four new divisions (electrification, industrial automation, motion, and robotics & discrete automation) replacing electrification products, industrial automation, robotics & motion, and power grids. Moreover, the company's longtime matrix organizational structure would be ditched in favor of the pyramid structure that most other companies use.",
        "Did I mention that Spiesshofer left in April, and the company would be embarking on these changes without a permanent CEO in place?  No matter: Former Sandvik CEO Bjorn Rosengren was appointed CEO in August. Meanwhile, the portfolio pruning continues with the recent announcement that ABB would be giving up on solar energy by exiting its solar inverter business.",
        "Putting all this together, there's a lot of opportunities for Rosengren to turn around ABB. And a glass-half-full approach sees all the changes -- such as divisional restructuring, organizational change, portfolio pruning, management change, and digital investments -- as preparing the company for a significant turnaround under a new CEO. Throw in a yield of more than 4% while you wait, and it's a compelling proposition.",
        "Unfortunately, the glass-half-empty viewpoint sees a lot of turbulence ahead. There are three key points. First, the restructuring plans were put in place before the appointment of a new CEO, and he's likely to have his own ideas. Meanwhile, the changes are significant in scale, and it's highly unlikely that they will come without friction.",
        "Second, ABB's ongoing performance is weak. Electrification had a decent second quarter, but as you can see from the chart of comparable-orders growth below, ABB's growth is definitely slowing and margin remains an issue. Total comparable-orders growth was just 1% in the second quarter.",
        "Data source: ABB presentations.",
        "Third, there's clear evidence of a slowing in automation markets, with Rockwell Automation cutting sales and earnings guidance for the second time in 2019 \u00a0during its recen t earnings report,\u00a0and Emerson Electric 's management \u00a0talking of order project delays and a weakening environment in process automation.  It's highly unlikely that ABB is going to sail through the turbulence unscathed.",
        "All told, ABB is an interesting turnaround story. But anyone buying it will have to recognize that it's going to take time and, more importantly, the optics around it are going to get murky due to the weakening end-demand environment. In other words, it's a lot harder to tell just how well the restructuring efforts are going when sales growth is weakening or even turning negative.",
        "As such, ABB investors will need to be patient, and for most investors, the stock is probably worth avoiding for now.",
        "10 stocks we like better than ABB\r\n When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has quadrupled the market.*",

      "title": "Half of Americans Hope to Retire Before 65. Here's How to Do It. - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "Almost everyone wants to retire someday -- and the sooner, the better. Approximately 52% of Americans hope to exit the workforce before their 65th birthday, according to a recent survey by reverse-mortgage company American Advisors Group (AAG) , and 23% hope to retire before they're 60. That's an ambitious goal when you consider that millions of Americans are struggling to set aside any money for retirement each month, but it's possible if you're motivated.",
        "You shouldn't even try it without a financial plan, though. The same AAG study found that most Americans tend to underestimate the true costs of retirement, and this could trick you into thinking you're ready to retire early when you're not. Here are three steps you must take if you're serious about retiring early -- and comfortably.",
        "Image source: Getty Images.",
        "You won't know if retiring early is feasible until you estimate the costs. Start by subtracting your ideal retirement age from your estimated life expectancy. It's not unreasonable to think you could live past 90 if you're pretty healthy, which means you could be looking at 30 to 40 years in retirement.",
        "Next, total up your estimated annual expenses in retirement. \u00a0(Some expenses, like healthcare, will probably rise, while others, like child care, will decrease or disappear entirely.) Multiply this amount by the number of years of your retirement, but don't forget about inflation. An average of 3% per year is a good estimate, and a retirement calculator can factor this in for you. It'll also calculate how much your savings could grow based on your investment rate of return. Choose a 5% or 6% annual rate to be conservative. Once you've filled all this out, your calculator should tell you the total amount you need to save and how much you must save per month to hit your goal.",
        "From this, subtract any money you expect from Social Security, a pension, or a 401(k) match to figure out the amount you need to save on your own. You can estimate your Social Security benefit by creating a my Social Security account . Keep in mind you aren't eligible to claim Social Security benefits until you reach age 62.",
        "Try to save as much as your retirement calculator recommends per month. This is easier if you start while you're younger because your earlier contributions have more time to grow and benefit from compouding before you need to begin drawing upon them.",
        "Consider a $10,000 contribution made in a single year. It would be worth almost $38,700 after 20 years, with a 7% annual rate of return. After 30 years, that $10,000 contribution would be worth over $76,000; after 40 years, nearly $150,000. Later contributions don't have as much time to gain value before you have to begin drawing upon them, so if you start later, you must save comparatively more each month than someone who began saving for retirement immediately upon entering the workforce.",
        "You can save up to $19,000 in a 401(k) in 2019, or $25,000 if you're 50 or older; and $6,000 in an IRA, or $7,000 if you're 50 or older. You can save more if you're able to and think you might like to retire even earlier than your original plan.",
        "Take advantage of any 401(k) match you're offered, but be mindful of its vesting schedule , which determines when employer-matched funds are yours to keep. If you leave the company before you're fully vested, you could lose some or all of your 401(k) match.",
        "After creating your retirement plan , you might find that you can't save enough each month to make that happen. There are a few ways to correct this. The easiest is just to delay your retirement by a few months or years. This gives you additional time to save while also reducing the total cost of your retirement.",
        "But if you're determined to retire early, consider reducing your expenses both now and in retirement. Look for ways to cut spending, like dining out less or canceling subscriptions you don't use. You could also reconsider your estimated retirement expenses and scale back your travel plans. Play around with different scenarios in your retirement calculator until you find one that will work for you.",
        "Another option is to seek out ways to boost your income, like working overtime, starting a side gig, pursuing a promotion, or switching companies or careers.",
        "Reevaluate your retirement plan at least once per year. If your goals have changed or you realize you miscalculated your expenses, it's easier to fix that with more frequent, gradual changes than it is to try to come up with tens or hundreds of thousands of additional dollars once you're retired.",
        "The $16,728 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\r\n If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

      "text": [
        " If you're affected by a hurricane, flood or another natural   disaster, what does it mean for your mortgage? This is a   pertinent question for homeowners in the path of Hurricane Dorian   in Florida and\u00a0nearby states. Here are frequently asked   questions and answers. What should I do first? Get in touch with the following entities:  The Federal Emergency Management Agency. You can          register with FEMA online      , in person at a disaster recovery center or by calling     800-621-3362. Your homeowners insurance company, plus your flood or     earthquake insurance company, if either applies to your     situation. Your mortgage servicer. That's the company that you send     your monthly payments to; it might not be your original     mortgage lender.  I can't pay my mortgage. What are my options? If the disaster makes it impossible to make your monthly house   payments, ask your servicer for mortgage forbearance. A   forbearance \"allows you to stop making your payments for an   agreed-upon time,\" a Freddie Mac spokesperson said.makeArticleAd(); Both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae offer forbearance options. In a forbearance agreement, you might make partial payments or   stop making payments for a specific time. Generally, a   forbearance lasts up to six months and can be extended up to   another six months. Interest still accrues during the time you   aren't\u00a0making full monthly payments. But under a forbearance   agreement, the lender won't charge late fees or report you to   credit bureaus. The lender will want you to catch up on your missed payments   after the forbearance period is over. That might involve paying   extra every month for a few years, modifying the loan or reaching   some other negotiated agreement. To talk\u00a0with a Department of Housing and Urban   Development-approved housing counselor before agreeing to   forbearance, call 800-569-4287. What aid is available? Direct federal aid consists mostly of loans from the Small   Business Administration. As odd as that may seem, the SBA is in   charge of delivering disaster-related loans to individuals and   families. The   SBA extends loans    at favorable interest rates to replace or repair primary   residences. You can borrow up to $200,000 to cover renovation or   construction costs. Whether you're a renter or a homeowner, the   SBA will lend you up to $40,000 to replace personal property such   as clothing, furniture, appliances and vehicles.  FEMA offers grants    to fill in gaps between insurance payouts and SBA loans. The   current maximum grant is $34,000 per household for disasters that   happen on or after October 1, 2017. Grants can be used for   expenses such as basic home repairs that aren't covered by   insurance, temporary rent and disaster-caused medical and child   care. The Federal Housing Administration has a program that's   designed to help disaster survivors rebuild or buy replacement   homes.   Under the Section 203(h) program    , the FHA insures mortgages for people whose homes were destroyed   or damaged in disasters. Borrowers don't have to make a down   payment. My house was destroyed. Should I keep paying the   mortgage? Keep paying the home loan - if you can afford to - until you   have talked with the servicer and have reached a settlement with   the insurance company. \"Safety and peace of mind are most important,\" a Fannie Mae   spokesperson said in an email. \"If the borrower is able to   continue making their monthly payment they should continue to do   so. They should also know that there are\u00a0relief   options\u00a0available to individuals and families who have been   impacted by natural disasters.\" Note: If you apply for a loan from the SBA, it\u00a0runs a   credit check before inspecting your property. That's one reason   to preserve your credit score by paying your bills on time as   best you can. What happens if I stop mortgage payments without telling   my\u00a0servicer? If you stop making payments without permission from your   mortgage servicer, you could be charged late fees and your credit   score could fall. Homeowners \"should call their lender,\" says Brian Sullivan,   supervisory public affairs specialist for HUD. \"Don't stop   answering the phone. Don't stop opening your mail.\" Talk with your\u00a0mortgage servicer before you miss a   payment. The servicer might offer forbearance. What if I can't contact my mortgage servicer? Whether your loan is guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac,   insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans   Affairs, the servicer is expected to reach out to you. In response to past hurricanes, for example, Freddie   Mac\u00a0allowed servicers to \"verbally grant\" 90-day   forbearances, and Fannie Mae\u00a0let servicers grant 90-day   forbearances, even if they\u00a0couldn't contact the impacted   homeowner immediately. Even so, you should call the servicer or answer the mortgage   company's calls. What happens if I'm in foreclosure? Mortgage servicers receive foreclosure guidance from federal   agencies, and the recommendations vary depending on   the\u00a0disaster. The house I was buying was destroyed or damaged. What happens   now? If a\u00a0disaster happens between appraisal and closing, \"the   lender is expected to take prudent and reasonable actions to   determine whether the condition of the property may have   materially changed since the effective date of the appraisal   report,\" according to Fannie Mae's guide to lenders. If the damage is relatively minor and covered by insurance,   the mortgage can be closed. But if the damage is uninsured, or if   it's major, then the house must be repaired before the   mortgage\u00a0can go through.

      "title": "Alaska Airlines Returns to Growth in California - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "In the year after it completed its late-2016 acquisition of smaller rival Virgin America, Alaska Air Group (NYSE: ALK) went on a growth spree in California. This included adding more than a dozen new routes in San Francisco, Virgin America's largest base of operations.",
        "In early 2018, Alaska acknowledged that many of its new California routes were performing poorly, due partly to stiff competition from Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) and United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) , the top two airlines in the state. As a result, Alaska cut many of the routes it had added in 2017, as well as some that it had inherited from Virgin America.",
        "Alaska Airlines' 2017 expansion in California had mixed results. Image source: Alaska Airlines.",
        "Since then, Alaska Airlines has focused its growth on its home territory: the Pacific Northwest. However, the carrier plans to return to growth in California in 2020, albeit with a more surgical approach to expansion.",
        "A substantial chunk of Alaska Air's growth in California during 2017 came in San Francisco. That put it into competition with United Airlines, a rival that has become extremely aggressive about protecting its market share in recent years.",
        "United operates about 300 daily departures in San Francisco, whereas Alaska operates just 133 daily departures across all three Bay Area airports combined. United responded to Alaska's growth in San Francisco by adding even more capacity to the market. United Airlines has been able to maintain its status as the preferred airline there by offering a broader route network and more schedule options on each route -- not to mention aggressive pricing.",
        "Elsewhere in California, Southwest Airlines reigns supreme. The low-fare airline had a similar reaction to Alaska's 2017 growth spurt in the state. Southwest countered by adding more flights at several airports in California and rolling out California-only frequent-flier promotions to further solidify the loyalty of its customer base.",
        "Southwest responded aggressively to Alaska Airlines' growth in California in 2017. Image source: Southwest Airlines.",
        "Considering this context, it shouldn't be too surprising that Alaska Air's growth in California had very mixed results. Some routes have become successful, while others quickly proved unsustainable. As Alaska retreated from various California routes during 2018, the competitive environment there gradually became more rational .",
        "On Wednesday, Alaska Air announced a slew of new service from its hubs and focus cities in California that will start up in the first half of 2020. It will launch eight new routes and add extra trips on seven existing ones.",
        "From San Francisco, Alaska will launch twice-daily service to Spokane, Washington, along with daily flights to Anchorage, Alaska, and Redmond/Bend, Oregon. From Los Angeles, it will begin flying twice a day to Spokane and Boise, Idaho, and once a day to Missoula, Montana, and Redmond/Bend. Lastly, it will add daily flights between San Diego and Redmond/Bend. All of these new routes, except San Francisco-Anchorage, will be operated with E175 regional jets.",
        "Meanwhile, Alaska will add a seventh daily flight from San Francisco to Orange County, California, and a second daily San Francisco-Chicago flight. From San Diego, it will increase service to Boise; Boston; Orlando, Florida; San Jose, California; and Santa Rosa, California.",
        "It's noteworthy that all eight new routes that Alaska Airlines announced this week will connect California to the Pacific Northwest, a region where Alaska is the top airline. (For example, as of 2016, it held more than 50% market share in Redmond/Bend.) A couple of the routes getting extra flights serve the Pacific Northwest, too.",
        "By focusing its growth on routes connecting California (where it is the upstart) to the Pacific Northwest (where it is the entrenched leader), Alaska Airlines is playing to its strengths. As a result, the new routes are more likely to be successful than many of the routes introduced in 2017.",
        "Several of the routes where the company is adding extra flights are more competitive, but in those markets, the performance of Alaska's existing flights should give the carrier a good sense of the demand for its service. Southwest Airlines and United Airlines may still respond to this recent growth announcement. However, this time around, they probably won't be able to upend Alaska Airlines' growth plan in California, as they did back in 2017.",
        "With Alaska Airlines currently trading for just 10 times its projected 2019 earnings and gearing up for a return to growth, the company looks like a great stock for long-term investors to buy.",

      "title": "Better Buy: General Electric vs. Verizon - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "If you spend any time watching the ups and downs of Wall Street, then the names General Electric (NYSE: GE) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) will be familiar to you. While they operate in very different industries, they are both iconic companies with incredible histories. That said, one is in a decidedly better position today than the other. Here's what you need to know to pick between GE and Verizon.",
        "General Electric operates in the industrial space, with a diverse set of businesses including energy, aviation, and healthcare. But it doesn't provide consumers with products( at least not anymore); it sells products to other companies. For example, it makes the giant turbines that produce power from the wind. Your local electric company probably buys from GE, with you benefiting from the power much further down the line. Industrials, however, tend to be cyclical in nature, since capital spending usually rises and falls with the economy.",
        "Image source: Getty Images.",
        "Verizon is a telecommunications company, with one of the largest market positions in the U.S. cellular phone space. Although it provides products and services to businesses, it predominantly sells directly to customers. But not just one or two large customers -- millions of small customers. So the loss of any one customer isn't a big deal. Moreover, what it sells is basically a necessity. When times are flush, its business will probably look boring, but in a recession its business will generally hold of relatively well.",
        "That said, both GE and Verizon are dealing with big shifts today. Verizon, for example, has been trying to maintain its strength in telecom while building up a position in the content that gets delivered to its customers through its systems. Content is a big story today, with tech upstarts like Netflix \u00a0and Amazoncompeting with entrenched industry giants like Disney for dominance. Wading into this fight hasn't been going very well for Verizon, which was forced to write down the value of its investments in industry also-rans Yahoo! and AOL.",
        "The strength of its core telecom business, however, has allowed Verizon to make this mistake without too much financial pain, and the company remains solidly profitable. It has also continued to raise the dividend annually with little trouble, with a 14-year streak of annual increases behind it. ",
        "VZ data by YCharts .",
        "GE, meanwhile, is still dealing with the fallout from its decision to allow its finance division to vastly outgrow its core purpose (helping customers buy its products). The division eventually got into everything from insurance to home mortgages, areas that have been problematic for it since the deep 2007-2009 recession.",
        "Although the industrial company has been working to deal with the issue, its effort hasn't been going well . And the pain has lingered for a decade, ultimately leading to multiple restructuring efforts, asset sales, a lot of red ink, and the reduction of the dividend to a token $0.04 per share per year. Meanwhile, some of its key divisions, notably energy and oil and natural gas, have been facing headwinds of their own.",
        "So GE is fighting on two fronts today as it tries to recover from past mistakes and deal with the ups and downs within its cyclical industrial operations. That's not a great combo for investors and helps explain why the stock has fallen 75% over the past three years. (For reference, Verizon's stock , despite the company's own self-inflicted wounds, is up 6% over the same span.)",
        "That said, both Verizon and GE have debt-heavy balance sheets today. However, there's a big difference between these two companies. Verizon's operations are supported by massive infrastructure investments. While costly, they provide protection from competition. It would be hard, if not impossible, to create from scratch what Verizon has. That provides the company with a valuable moat to protect itself and support its long-term success. Verizon also has lots of small customers that consider its products and services a necessity in good times and bad, so affording that leverage shouldn't be a huge deal.",
        "VZ Debt to Equity Ratio (Quarterly) data by YCharts .",
        "GE, on the other hand, has a heavy debt load and an often volatile business that is struggling today. The debt is left over from its past mistakes, and there's no easy way to deal with it. Right now, the focus is on selling assets at what some consider fire-sale prices . GE has even begun to sell parts of the businesses that are expected to be its long-term growth engine . While these moves may be buying the company financial breathing room, they could also end up weakening its long-term outlook. In other words, debt is a much-bigger problem for GE today than it is for Verizon.",
        "Although this is something of a top-level view, it's pretty clear that Verizon is in a much better position today than General Electric. At this point, GE is really a high-risk turnaround stock that only the most aggressive investors should be looking at -- and even then, the risks may outweigh the potential rewards.",
        "Verizon, on the other hand, has a dominant and well-protected industry position, and a still-strong core business. Even though its efforts to reach into new areas haven't gone quite as well as planned, it remains a strong company. It's worth a look even for conservative investors , noting its hefty 4.2% yield should be particularly attractive to those with an income focus. That said, there are other companies with financially strong businesses, moat-worthy operations, solid growth prospects, and management teams that have avoided costly capital allocation mistakes.\u00a0So before hitting the buy button on Verizon, despite its being a far better choice than GE, you should probably consider more options.",

      "text": [
        "As the summer drifts away, so too does the lates t quarterly earnings season. Along with other equities, most marijuana stocks have already reported their most recent figures.",
        "Most, but not all. This week, we saw one cannabis company report, while another received a recommendation boost but also a tough reminder of how its stock has been performing lately.",
        "Image source: Getty Images.",
        "The week started off quite well for Canopy Growth (NYSE: CGC) . Prior to market open on Monday, it received a significant recommendation upgrade from Seaport Global, one of the investment banks tracking the stock.",
        "Analyst Brett Hundley lifted his stance on Canopy Growth from neutral to buy, with a price target of $31 per share. (It closed at $24.89 on the previous trading day; its latest closing price is $23.58.) Hundley opined that the cannabis industry, in general, presents an attractive opportunity, and Canopy Growth is poised to take advantage of this.",
        "The analyst cited the company's portfolio of intellectual property and its research and development efforts as potential sources of value-added goods that could be attractive to the market. He was also complimentary about Canopy Growth's balance sheet, which is seen as relatively clean compared to peers in this frequently debt-burdened sector.",
        "Later in the week, though, Canopy Growth's major shareholder Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ) said it would take a $54 million hit from its investment in the marijuana stock. Much of this decline came in the wake of Canopy Growth reporting its Q1 of fiscal 2020 . This was a tough period in which revenue actually declined on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and the net loss was far deeper than the average analyst estimate.",
        "Since the company reported the mentioned quarter in mid-August, investor enthusiasm for the stock has weakened. The Seaport Global recommendation was certainly a boost, but that terrible Q1 performance has left a lingering bad impression. And Constellation Brands' stark reminder that Canopy Growth has burned a big strategic investor is not helping.",
        "Earnings season might be vanishing in the rearview mirror, but there's still the occasional marijuana stock reporting its fundamentals. This week saw Q2 of fiscal 2019 results handed down by Curaleaf Holdings (OTC: CURLF) , and although every line item was not a bright spot, investors generally liked what they saw.",
        "The company's net revenue more than tripled on a year-over-year basis, although net loss was almost five times as deep and worse than the average analyst estimate.",
        "Yet losses in the marijuana industry are common and expected, particularly considering the expenses required to ramp up presence and footprint in most segments of this business. Curaleaf is no different, as evidenced by its recent deal to buy vaporizer cartridge maker Cura Partners . The price tag? A cool $950 million. On top of that, it's also paying $875 million to take over dispensary operator Grassroots.",
        "Curaleaf's Q2 wasn't a flame-out like Canopy Growth's Q1. Investors these days are far more sunnier about the former company's prospects -- the stock was among the best performers in the sector over the week, rising by 10%.",
        "Here's The Marijuana Stock You've Been Waiting For A little-known Canadian company just unlocked what some experts think could be the key to profiting off the coming marijuana boom. ",
        "And make no mistake - it is coming.",

      "text": [
        "By Chad Terhune",
        "Aug 30 (Reuters) - An unnamed hospital in Oklahoma used contaminated gastroscopes in procedures performed on nearly a thousand patients in recent months, device maker Pentax Medical told U.S. regulators last month, putting the patients at risk of exposure to bacteria that can cause infections.",
        "In a  that only recently became public and was reviewed by Reuters, Pentax told the Food and Drug Administration that a hospital used up to four gastroscopes contaminated with bacteria in 998 procedures performed sometime last year through June 2019, when the problem was discovered. Pentax, a unit of Tokyo-based Hoya Corp , said it was not aware of any patient infections thus far (graphic).",
        "The FDA redacts the names of hospitals from device injury reports before releasing them publicly. \"Per FDA regulation, we are not permitted to disclose the facility identity publicly,\" agency spokeswoman Alison Hunt said.",
        "Neither Pentax nor the Oklahoma State Department of Health would name the hospital involved.",
        "In a statement to Reuters, Pentax described the incident as a \"failure by the facility reprocessing personnel to completely follow\" the company's cleaning instructions for gastroscopes.",
        "The company said the \"hospital has notified all potentially affected patients of their options for post-exposure medical screening.\"",
        "The FDA echoed Pentax's assessment and said regulators \"have determined that the manufacturer's reprocessing instructions were not followed.\" The agency said it is continuing to discuss the incident with Pentax and the hospital to learn more details.",
        "Gastroscopes, like other endoscopes, are brushed and washed with disinfectants in preparation for the next patient. Despite those efforts, contamination can persist and patients can be exposed to drug-resistant bacteria and develop infections that are difficult or even impossible to treat.",
        "They are not required to be sterilized, a process that for many manufacturers would require design changes to enable complex scopes to withstand gas or chemicals.",
        "DESIGN HINDERS CLEANING",
        "U.S. Senator Patty Murray of Washington state, who led a Senate investigation into duodenoscope infections following an outbreak at a Seattle hospital several years ago, expressed concern about the persistent lapses in patient safety related to endoscopy despite years of scrutiny by regulators and lawmakers.",
        "Duodenoscopes are another type of endoscope.",
        "Murray told Reuters that families \"should be confident the medical equipment they rely on for critical procedures is safe. But I'm still very concerned about the risks here and I'm going to keep pushing for more transparency, more accountability and stronger protections for patients.\"",
        "Researchers say the intricate design of many endoscopes, with narrow channels and tiny crevices, hinders cleaning and those problems are compounded when health workers skip steps or ignore basic protocols in a rush to get scopes ready for the next patient.",
        "In a study published last year in the American Journal of Infection Control, 71% of reusable scopes deemed ready for use on patients tested positive for bacteria at three U.S. hospitals. The study found problems with gastroscopes, colonoscopes and bronchoscopes, among others.",
        "\"Scopes get highly contaminated every time they're used,\" said Cori Ofstead, the study's author and an epidemiologist in St. Paul, Minnesota. In the latest incident involving gastroscopes, she said, \"It appears the institution continued to use damaged scopes, and inadequate cleaning allowed potential pathogens to remain on the scopes.\"",
        "In its filing to the FDA, Pentax said the \"forward water jet channel\" was not properly cleaned on three of the gastroscopes and a \"foreign liquid was evacuated from at least one of the devices upon flushing\" that channel. After discovering the problem, the hospital took the scopes out of service and returned them to Pentax.",
        "Some infection-control experts have urged manufacturers and regulators to move toward sterilization for scopes, which would be a step above the current U.S. requirement for high-level disinfection. ",
        "Some companies are selling single-use scopes as a safer alternative, but reusable devices continue to be used widely.",
        "In 2015, the FDA ordered Pentax and two other scope manufacturers - Olympus Corp and Fujifilm Holdings Corp - to conduct surveillance studies after the spread of antibiotic-resistant \"superbugs\" at U.S. and European hospitals from contaminated duodenoscopes. Those gastrointestinal scopes are put down a patient's throat to diagnose and treat problems such as gallstones, cancers and blockages in the bile duct.",
        "In April, the FDA said 5.4% of duodenoscopes tested positive during those industry studies for \"high concern\" organisms such as E. coli, even after being disinfected. The FDA said that contaminated duodenoscopes were linked to three deaths last year and 45 reports of patient infection from October 2018 to March 31.",
        "This week, FDA urged hospitals and device makers to adopt newer models of duodenoscopes that have disposable parts that can aid cleaning and reduce the risk of infection.",
        "\"We recognize that a full transition away from conventional duodenoscopes to innovative models will take time and immediate transition is not possible for all health care facilities due to cost and market availability,\" Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA'sCenter for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement Thursday."

        "WASHINGTON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Telegram, a popular encrypted messaging app, will allow users to cloak their telephone numbersto safeguard Hong Kong protesters against monitoring by Chinese authorities, according to a person with direct knowledge of the effort.",
        "The update to Telegram, planned for release over the next few days, will allow protesters to block Chinese authorities from discovering their identities in the app's large group chats.",
        "The groups are used to post everything from news on upcoming protests to tips on dousing tear gas canisters fired by the police to the identities of suspected undercover police and the access codes to buildings in Hong Kong where protesters can hide.",
        "Protesters have grown concerned that Chinese authorities could use the movement's reliance on Telegram to monitor and arrest organizers. Telegram chat groups used to organize public protests are often accessible to anyone and participants use pseudonyms.",
        "But a feature in Telegram's design may have allowed Chinese authorities to learn the real identities of users, according to a group of Hong Kong engineers who posted their finding on a online forum earlier this month.",
        "Telegram allows users to search for other users by uploading phone numbers. This function allows a new user to quickly learn whether those in her phone's contact book are already using the app, the group said.",
        "Protesters believe Chinese security officials have exploited the function by uploading large quantities of phone numbers.",
        "The app automatically matches phone numbers with the user names in the group. Chinese authorities then only need to request the owners of the phone numbers from the local telecom service in order to learn the users' true identities.",
        "Telegram has detected evidence that Chinese authorities may have uploaded numbers to identify protesters, said a person with direct knowledge of the situation. But it is unclear whether Chinese authorities have successfully used this tactic to locate protesters.",
        "Government authorities in Hong Kong did not respond to a request for comment.",
        "The fix Telegram is working on would allow users to disable matching by phone number. That option represents a balance between making it easy for users to find their contacts and the privacy needs of those who rely on the app for protection against state security agents.",
        "Telegram hopes to help protect Hong Kong protesters with the update, the source said. But wide adoption of the optional security setting would make the app far harder to use for the vast majority of its more than 200 consumers, who rely on uploading phone contacts to identify friends and family members on the app, the source said.",
        "The move by Telegram comes as Hong Kong police arrested a number of prominent activists and three lawmakers on Friday.  Nearly 900 people have been arrested since the demonstrations began three months ago.",
        "With protesters and authorities at an impasse and Hong Kong facing its first recession in a decade, speculation has grown that the city government may impose emergency law, giving it extra powers over detentions, censorship and curfews.",

        "This video was recorded on Aug. 29, 2019.",
        "Nick Sciple: Welcome to Industry Focus , the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. Today is Thursday, August 29th, and we're discussing Tesla, once again. I'm your host, Nick Sciple, and today I'm joined in studio by Motley Fool analyst Jim Mueller. How's it going, Jim?",
        "Jim Mueller: Hey, Nick! How are you?",
        "Sciple: I'm doing great! It's been a while since we've had you in the studio, Jim. How has life been?",
        "Mueller: It's been well. It's been pretty good. Enjoying the weather here at the end of August, which is a strange thing to say in the D.C. area, but it's actually nice out today.",
        "Sciple: Yeah. Labor Day weekend. I'm heading down to Atlanta for a kickoff college football. Very excited. Last time I had you on the show was a little bit under a year ago. We were talking about the U.S.-China trade war. We were talking about tariffs. We're talking about, when we get into 2019, maybe this will slack off. Any updates on what's going on there, Jim?",
        "Mueller: Yeah, no such luck on the slack off there. It's going fast and furious. The effects are actually beginning to be felt now by U.S. companies and will likely be felt by consumers soon. For instance, Deere lowered the guidance -- the maker of the big farm equipment -- because farmers are not buying the equipment because they're not being able to sell a lot of their crops to China. Qualcomm lowered their guidance recently, as well, because they're a chip supplier into China, where they use the chips to manufacture all kinds of consumer electronics. Importers are dealing with the tariffs in many different ways. They're not raising wages. They're actually passing on prices to consumers. For example, Walmart recently said they're going to have to raise the prices of the stuff they sell in their stores, just in time for Christmas. That's going to make it painful for American consumers. And then, the whole shifting supply chains thing. President Trump urged American businesses to get out of China recently. Companies are already trying to, but after decades of building up China as the manufacturer of the world, and the web that involves the suppliers to the manufacturers and the suppliers to the suppliers, it's not easy to make shifts away from China and find, hopefully, as inexpensive manufacturing, but then, the support infrastructure is not there. It's just a hot mess right now.",
        "Sciple: Yeah. I think literally and figuratively, you could say there are a lot of moving parts here. A lot of things to navigate. It's been tough for folks. Not even [just] in the U.S. Germany has talked about slowing auto markets in China as a result of this. It's hurt their economy. A lot of trickle down issues. Hopefully, it gets resolved. But we're not that different from where we've been a year ago when we were talking about this.",
        "We are talking about Tesla today. The main topic we're going to talk about today is Tesla Solar, which has really been in the news a lot recently. But we did get some more Tesla news last night, which has been interesting. Tesla Insurance launched in California last night. We've been waiting for that product launch since it was first mentioned by Elon Musk and Tesla back in May. It finally launched last night in California. However, three hours later, the product was pulled down for an algorithm update. I checked Tesla's website today -- that's still ongoing. Obviously, things are continuing to play out. But just high-level thoughts on this rollout and what's been going on so far?",
        "Mueller: I don't know what Tesla's experience is in insurance. Are they the ones pricing the insurance? Or do they have another company pricing the insurance for them, and Tesla's just being the front man? It's not really clear, at least not to me. One thing that does concern me is an item that says that Tesla owners will be able to get rates 20%, maybe even 30% cheaper than they could at other insurers. That makes me wonder whether Tesla or the underwriter actually has enough data to justify a lower price like that. Insurance rates are set by data, both by how much it costs to repair the cars, how often the cars get into accidents and have to be totaled, yada yada on that line, as well as the driver him or herself, how often they get into accidents or make claims, and so on. Is there enough data for any underwriter at this point to say, \"Hey, we're going to give you a 20% lower rate because you deserve it and because the data backs us up?\" And it's that \"data backs us up\" part that I'm not too sure about in this situation.",
        "Sciple: Yeah. Obviously, still a developing story. They're doing this algorithm update. We'll see how those rates materialize. But something to watch going forward.",
        "The main topic I want to talk about today, though, is Tesla Solar. In the past week, it's been all over the news. SolarCity, since the 2016 acquisition by Tesla for $6.5 billion, the solar business has flown under the radar. The solar roof has been a lot in the news. Musk will periodically surface and say, \"Hey, we're about to ramp up the solar roof.\" But solar has really been brought front and center in recent days following a spate of legal filings and some associated articles. Can you just introduce us to those, Jim, at a high level?",
        "Mueller: The big legal filing that probably hit the news most surprisingly is Walmart filing suit recently, saying that it was, what, 140 roofs that they had?",
        "Sciple: It was over 200 roofs, seven that had fire issues.",
        "Mueller: Seven had fires over the last couple of years, and they could, they felt reasonably secure that they could trace that back to the solar panels that SolarCity had installed. The claim was that SolarCity employees -- that is, Tesla employees -- were not inspecting the roofs on a regular schedule, were not maintaining them as they were required to, and therefore, Walmart believes that Tesla Solar was in breach of contract. And basically, I think they want the solar panels removed, and Walmart reimbursed for the expenses of having to close down the stores, the loss of inventory, the damage, the repairs, and all that stuff.",
        "Sciple: Yeah. This is a dispute that, if you read through the legal filings, has been ongoing going back [to] 2018 and earlier, but finally reached the point where Walmart filed a lawsuit. Obviously, it's a legal filing, but some very aggressive language in there. I think \"utter incompetence\" were the words they'd used. So obviously, this affected the company.",
        "And then, over the top again, this week on Sunday, we got Bethany McLean, very famous for outing the Enron scandal, coming into this Tesla story, publishing an article in Vanity Fair titled \"He's Full of [S**t]: How Elon Musk Fooled Investors, Bilked Taxpayers, and Gambled Tesla to Save SolarCity.\" Jim, just another high level, what is McLean talking about in this article?",
        "Mueller: What she's talking about there is that Elon Musk forced through the purchase of SolarCity by Tesla. She's basing her article on reporting by the Buffalo News , especially David Robinson, in that the bailout was basically misleading investors and shareholders who had to vote to approve it. Even though Musk and the Reeve brothers and Kimbal, I believe, all recused themselves from the vote, everyone knew what these guys wanted to happen, so there was pressure for that. There was a big presentation, which launched the idea of the solar roof, and Musk presenting what appeared to be solar roofs already installed on some buildings. Turned out to be just a mockup, installed on the set of, what was it, Desperate Housewives ?",
        "Sciple: Yeah. It was the backlot.",
        "Mueller: Backlot film, used in Desperate Housewives . And this was going to be the saving grace of SolarCity. It was going to cause a bunch of cash flow into Tesla, which would be great for the company, and instead has led to all kinds of problems, including debt issues, debt repayments, declining sales of solar panels by SolarCity, halting of their marketing themselves, and going out to the house and doing the inspection themselves. Now, the homeowner is supposed to take pictures and send it to SolarCity to have the product figured out. It's just been going downhill, and it has the potential to really cause some serious problems for Tesla, unfortunately.",
        "Sciple: Sure. The other issue that you mentioned there, as well, is that the business, when they had first acquired the factory, received $750 million in financing from New York State. At the time, Tesla had planned to build 10,000 solar panels per day, create thousands of jobs in Buffalo. As a condition of that funding from New York State. SolarCity, which became part of Tesla, later got a 10-year lease on the property in Buffalo for $1 a year, was tasked with: employing 1,460 high-tech jobs at the factory, another 2,000 in support and sales installation folks, another 1,440 jobs in the state, and pledged to spend $5 billion in New York State over the next decade. However, as Jim mentioned, we've seen installations decline, and they haven't quite hit those job numbers yet.",
        "Mueller: Even the employee numbers. Tesla itself said there were only a few hundred employees in the state and only a fraction of those in Buffalo itself. Then we have Elon Musk coming out and saying, \"Hey, we're ramping up production of the solar roof.\" I don't know if he actually said they expect to make 1,000 a week by the end of this year, whether that was an expectation or a hope or whatever, but with only a few hundred employees at this plant in Buffalo, it really doesn't seem as if the company's even going to be able to make that target even if it is making solar roofs today, which is in doubt itself, unfortunately.",
        "Sciple: Yeah. Just to back up, with the SolarCity acquisition, Tesla had acquired a business that had two-thirds of the residential solar market in the U.S. They claimed that it would add more than $500 million dollars to Tesla's balance sheet over the next three years. In reality, what has materialized is that it has drastically increased Tesla's debt position, their market share has declined meaningfully down to 7% of the U.S. residential solar market, their installations have declined about 85% since that date. So as a result, what is Tesla left with after this transaction today?",
        "Mueller: Tesla's left with a business that seems to be in decline and disappearing, actually. Tesla Solar only installed 29 megawatts of panels in the second quarter of this year. That's down from 200 megawatts installed just two years prior in the second quarter of 2016. With the solar roofs not really out there yet, I don't know where SolarCity is going to be able to generate any sort of revenue or cash flow for the company. What that leaves Tesla and Tesla shareholders saddled with is a bunch of debt that Tesla also bought when they bought SolarCity. One of the pieces is coming due on November 1st. It's a $556 million convertible bond. The bond holders have the choice on November 1st of either converting their bonds into shares of Tesla or receiving their cash investment back plus any unpaid interest. Given that the conversion prices are in the $500 to $700 range of Tesla, and where Tesla shares are trading today -- in the low $200 range -- no holder in their right mind of any of those bonds is going to say, \"OK, I don't want my cash. You can keep the cash. Just give me shares of Tesla when I'm asking for something that's worth a third less than what I gave you.\" So Tesla's going to have to come up with $556 million plus a little bit of interest and pay that off. If they don't -- and this is an unfortunate consequence of the purchase of SolarCity -- if they don't pay that when it comes due in two months, that can have serious consequences.",
        "If they miss that payment, then other bonds that they have out -- for instance, there's a convertible bond due in March of 2022 that says, \"If you fail to pay off any other mortgage or bond or borrowing worth $150 million or more, then our bond is going to be declared to be in default, and we have the right to accelerate the payment.\" And that particular bond, on June 30th, had a balance of $977 million. So if Tesla fails to pay that $556 million, then all of a sudden, they could be asked to pay another $977 million, and then the other bondholders -- there's just this whole cascade effect that could happen if Tesla fails to pay this.",
        "Now, is Tesla going to let that happen? I don't think so. They have to be aware of the covenants of the bonds they've issued. So unless they've already spent -- what did they have, $5 billion in cash on the balance sheet?",
        "Sciple: As of June 31st.",
        "Mueller: As of June 30th. There's no June 31st. [laughs]",
        "Sciple: [laughs]\u00a0I'm not here for my calendar skills.",
        "Mueller: [laughs]\u00a0Right. So if they've already spent a good chunk of that money elsewhere, such as paying back suppliers money that they owed their suppliers for the car business, or if they cannot somehow negotiate with the bondholders coming due and move the bond down the road, delaying payback like they've done with another bond several times, then if worst comes to worst, the cascading effect of multiple bonds coming due and there's no cash to pay it back could potentially lead to Tesla's bankruptcy. It would be a terrible thing for the shareholders and, I believe, for the world in general. Let's face it, Elon Musk has done a lot to get electric cars into the forefront of society's mind and to the big car manufacturers. VW is supposed to go all electric by 2025, something like that. BMW , Jaguar, GM , Toyota , everybody you can name is now making electric cars, and I don't think that tide is going to reverse. It'd be a real shame if Tesla was not there to enjoy the fruits of their labor.",
        "Sciple: Yeah. Whether that's going to happen, I don't know. The takeaway here, I think, from this whole SolarCity acquisition, is you had a transaction where shareholders were promised --",
        "Mueller: One thing.",
        "Sciple: -- were promised that they'd have a company that could make lower-than-market-rate solar panels that would have a dominant market share, that would continue growth into the future, and would meaningfully contribute to the company's bottom line going forward as part of its master plan. What has materialized is a declining operating business, a large amount of debt that has saddled the company with a number of complicated issues. Now, you have to allocate cash that otherwise should be going to capex [capital expenditures] to build your new cars, all those sorts of things, needs to go to servicing this debt, as well. And then, to bring this back to the Walmart issue, and Amazon issue, as well --",
        "Mueller: We didn't\u00a0mention that one. Amazon also reported a fire on a roof of theirs that had SolarCity panels on it.",
        "Sciple: Yeah. This story, on a number of levels, has also had a negative effect on Tesla. You have a perception issue when you have a very strongly worded negative lawsuit coming out from a major retailer like Walmart. As well, you have some amount of uncertain liability if this roof issue goes to other residential installations across the country. We've seen some follow-up reporting from Bloomberg on that.",
        "Mueller: \u00a0And how much will it cost Tesla to settle with Walmart? And how much did it cost to settle with Amazon? And how much will it cost to settle with all those homeowners? And on and on and on.",
        "Sciple: It's a bag of worms that has really created a lot of issues for the company. We will say, Tesla has continued to tout the solar roof as something that is going to shift the narrative around the business. Again, customer trust has been impacted, as well. It's been a while since we've seen this come out. What are your thoughts on the prospects of the solar roof to turn the solar business around for Tesla?",
        "Mueller: If they can do it, and if the product meets the high bar that Musk set for it -- cheaper than a regular roof, longer lasting than a regular roof, and that's not even counting the electricity the roof is going to generate for you -- if they can do that, then that could indeed turn the situation around. There are several questions. One, does that solar roof actually exist? Or is it engineering drawings still on paper and not in production? Two, how soon can they get those out? Three, how rapidly can they ramp it up, given the other constraints on their cash and their cash flow? And four, are they too late to the market? I mean, SolarCity has declined as a big player in the solar panel market. Are customers willing to come back to them and try a brand-new product that hasn't been tested, that's not even out there yet, and might not come to the promises that have been given so far?",
        "Sciple: And has publicly caused a lot of fires?",
        "Mueller: \u00a0Well, the roof hasn't.",
        "Sciple: True, true. It's to be determined. A lot of things with Tesla, there's always this promise out in the future, whether it's full self-driving or the solar roof or the Chinese factory. We'll see how things materialize. I will say that the solar roof has been promised since October of 2016 when the SolarCity merger was beginning to happen. We're today, in August of 2019. Likewise, self-driving was promised around that same time and has not materialized. Those things are the sorts of levers that, if Tesla can pull them [off], all these question marks arguably could go away. But lots of things to navigate. It's a tough time to be navigating these issues if you're management at Tesla today.",
        "Alright, Jim, any positive thoughts going into Labor Day weekend? What are your plans?",
        "Mueller: Well, there was some positive news for Tesla, actually. Moody's , the bond rating agency, had some good news for Tesla. They affirmed the bond ratings they had for Tesla's current bonds. That means they didn't make it worse. They improved what's called the speculative grade liquidity level, which is a rating of the risk that a company that will not be able to meet its short-term liabilities. That's a definition I'm reading off The Free Dictionary. Level from four to three, four being the worst, one being the best, most liquid. So four to three. That's an improvement. They also changed the outlook on the company from negative to stable. That's a big thing for a company when it has to negotiate new debt or roll debt out or what have you. Having a stable outlook from one of the major bond rating agencies is good news for Tesla.",
        "Sciple: Yeah. We just had Elon Musk speak in China last night with Jack Ma, so we do have the China factory, also positive news coming down the line for Tesla. There's been some rumors that they're going to reveal that first vehicle they've produced at that factory. That'll be exciting to see. But lots to follow with this company in the future. It's always in the news, Jim.",
        "Mueller: That it is. That's what makes being a shareholder exciting, I guess.",
        "Sciple: It's a rollercoaster ride, for sure. Thanks for coming on, Jim, as always!",
        "Mueller: Thanks for having me!",

        "By Sarah Marsh",
        "HAVANA, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Communist-run Cuba unveiled tighter regulations on non-agricultural cooperatives on Friday, including curbs on their prices, in keeping with a broader push to increase control of the growing non-state sector.",
        "The new regulations aim to tackle \"irregularities\" detected in the cooperatives, state-run media reported.",
        "But a wary Cuban government froze the creation of new cooperatives two years ago. That freeze will be maintained during this \"experimental phase\" while the existing ones are consolidated, a senior official was cited as saying on website Cubadebate.",
        "There are an estimated 18,000 Cubans - some 0.4 percent of the total workforce of 4.4 million - working for non-agricultural cooperatives, in sectors deemed \"non-strategic\" like construction, transport, gastronomy and accountancy.",
        "Some economists said the new regulations, which enter into force in November, suggest the Communist Party is still nervous about allowing the non-state sector to grow. Without such growth, Havana may struggle to boost an ailing economy battling less Venezuelan aid and tighter U.S. sanctions, they said.",
        "\"I'm struck by the fact that the non-agricultural cooperatives are still seen as an experiment,\" said Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist, who teaches at Colombia's Universidad Javeriana Cali.",
        "\"This confirms the lack of confidence the Cuban government has in relation to everything that is non-state.\"",
        "State-run media on Friday detailed the \"irregularities\" that authorities said they had found at cooperatives. Some had been hiking prices too much and cooking their books, they cited Yovana Vega Matos of Cuba's economic reform commission as saying.",
        "Others were hiring too many contractors, or paying their directors disproportionately high wages, as if they were private companies and not cooperatives, they said.",
        "The new regulations stipulate cooperatives cannot pay directors more than three times the lowest-earning member nor hire more contractors than 10 percent of their total members - measures previously announced and now made official.",
        "They cap the amount cooperatives in some sectors can charge for their services by limiting their profits relative to expenses, and allow local authorities to implement price caps if necessary.",
        "The new rules also put limits on cooperatives' potential growth. Cooperatives of 101 members or more may not grow by more than 10 percent, for example.",
        "To be sure, the new regulations do respond to some of the cooperatives' demands, such as granting them the right to appeal if authorities shut them down via the courts.",
        "They also row back slightly on a previous decision to forbid cooperatives from operating nationwide, limiting them to the province where they are headquartered."

        "The black-and-white photo showed the fire-blasted launch site at a space center in northern Iran including a damaged gantry service tower and a downed mobile erector launcher.",
        "Speaking to reporters at the White House later on Friday, Trump defended his posting of the photo and reiterated that the United States had nothing to do with the incident.",
        "\"We had a photo. I released it, which I have the absolute right to do,\" Trump said.",

        "Tehran denies the U.S. accusation that such activity is a cover for ballistic missile development.",
        "The Trump administration has ratcheted up economic pressure on Iran this year with economic sanctions to try to force it to renegotiate a pact reached with world powers in 2015 limiting its nuclear program. Trump withdrew the United States from the pact in May last year.",

      "text": [
        "The YES Network has a new home. Disney (NYSE: DIS) agreed to sell the New York sports network that airs games of the Yankees, Nets, and other local teams to an investor group that includes the Yankees, Sinclair Broadcast Group (NASDAQ: SBGI) , and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) .",
        "Disney agreed to sell the 22 regional sports networks Twenty-First Century Fox owned soon after closing the deal to buy Fox in order to gain approval from the Justice Department. It sold 21 of those networks to Sinclair, but held back YES, which analysts deemed the crown jewel of the regional sports networks. That jewel ended up fetching about $3.5 billion.",
        "Now, Amazon has a piece of it, although it's not clear what level of involvement the tech giant will have in the network. YES could prove a valuable asset to attract consumers to Prime Video. It could also open the door for Amazon to develop more advertising technology.",
        "Image source: Getty Images",
        "Amazon has been investing in sports rights for a couple of years now. Its biggest endeavor has been Thursday Night Football , for which it pays $65 million per year just to rebroadcast another broadcaster's feed. It made the popular weekly sporting event available to Prime subscribers worldwide, and consumers can even watch free on Twitch, Amazon's gaming-focused streaming site.",
        "Amazon also owns regional rights to several other events including Premier League soccer and U.S. Open tennis. Grabbing the rights to Yankees and Nets games -- along with the Liberty of the WNBA and New York City FC of Major League Soccer -- even if regionally locked, might provide yet another boost.",
        "Due to restrictions with Major League Baseball, it's unlikely Amazon would be able to stream games outside of the YES Network's footprint. But there are a lot of people in New York, and access to the games on YES could tip the scales for more of them to subscribe to Prime. Once Amazon gets them to sign up for Prime, it can prove the value of its membership with services including Prime Now's two-hour grocery delivery and one-day shipping on millions more items. That's the game plan for Prime in general, but in a concentrated population center like New York, it makes sense to invest in regional content.",
        "That said, it's not clear how Sinclair feels about Amazon distributing the YES Network to Prime members. Sinclair owns several local stations in upstate New York, but none in New York City or New Jersey, where YES is most popular. It may be fine using Amazon as a distribution outlet, but it could hurt its ability to negotiate better rates with the bigger pay-TV providers.",
        "Another potential avenue for Amazon to participate in owning the YES Network is in building out its advertising technology platform. Amazon's biggest source of ad inventory comes from preferred placement in its marketplace search results and on product listing pages. It has a small but rapidly growing video ad business it's built out starting with placements during its Thursday Night Football streams. It now fills 30% of inventory on most ad-supported streaming video services available on its Fire TV platform, too.",
        "Building out an ad platform to sell YES Network ads programmatically could open the door for Amazon to take a piece of the $70 billion U.S. television advertising market. There's a growing interest in moving television ad buying into the digital age, and numerous platforms compete for the market. Amazon has access to both shopper and viewer data that can inform those ad buys and make television commercials more effective for marketers (and more bearable for viewers).",
        "As advertising becomes a significant source of revenue for Amazon, expanding its ad inventory will be key. Whether that inventory comes from streaming sports to local Yankees fans or actually placing ads on television broadcasts, it's a big opportunity for the e-commerce giant.",
        "10 stocks we like better than Amazon\r\n When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has quadrupled the market.*",
        "David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Amazon wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.",

        " In the latest trading session, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) closed at $838.24, marking a -0.64% move from the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.06%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.16%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.13%. Prior to today's trading, shares of the Mexican food chain had gained 6.73% over the past month. This has outpaced the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 1.4% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.95% in that time. Wall Street will be looking for positivity from CMG as it approaches its nex t earnings  report date. On that day, CMG is projected to report earnings of $3.13 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 44.91%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $1.37 billion, up 11.96% from the year-ago period. Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $13.34 per share and revenue of $5.48 billion. These totals would mark changes of +47.24% and +12.69%, respectively, from last year. Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for CMG. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability. Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 4.41%, while the S&P 500 lost 2.95%. AMD will be looking to display strength as it nears its nex t earnings  release.

      "title": "53% of Savers Are Setting Themselves Up for Retirement Failure - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "The average American thinks they'll need approximately $1.7 million to retire comfortably, a survey from Charles Schwab found. Considering the median amount baby boomers have saved for retirement is just $152,000, according to a report from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, there's a significant gap between what workers have saved and how much they may need to last the rest of their lives.",
        "To reach major saving milestones, like saving at least $1 million for retirement, you may think you simply need to supercharge your savings and make sacrifices to save as much as you can each month. But sometimes where you stash your money is just as important as how much you're saving. And more than half of those preparing for retirement are making this one mistake that could be setting them up for financial failure.",
        "Image Source: Getty Images",
        "Of those who are saving for retirement, 53% are stashing their money in a savings account, according to a survey from Morning Consult. At first glance that may seem like a perfectly acceptable place to store your cash. After all, savings accounts are safe, your money is protected from market downturns, and high-yield savings accounts can provide much higher returns than your average bank savings account.",
        "However, while savings accounts are a good place to park your cash for short-term needs, they're not the best option for long-term financial goals.",
        "Even the highest-yielding savings accounts have interest rates of just 1% to 2%, which may not even keep up with inflation. In other words, if left in a savings account for years or decades on end, your money may actually lose value. In addition, it's much harder to save as much as you need for retirement when you're earning a rate of return of only 1% to 2%.",
        "For example, say you have a goal of saving $750,000 by age 67, and you started saving at age 30. If you're stashing your money in a savings account earning 2% interest per year, you'd need to save just under $1,200 per month for 37 years to reach your goal. But if you had invested in the stock market and earned a 7% annual rate of return, you'd only need to save around $400 per month.",
        "Many people shy away from the stock market because it seems inherently risky. Especially given that so many investors are still recovering from their losses during the Great Recession, you may be hesitant to risk your hard-earned cash by putting it in the stock market. But the stock market isn't as risky as it may seem, and investing in it is the best way for workers to accumulate substantial savings in a relatively short time.",
        "Of course, you'll still need to be smart about where to put your money to avoid losing everything. If you invest your entire life savings in a new tech stock that you have a gut feeling will become the next household name, and that company goes under, you'll be in a heap of financial trouble. But by investing in relatively safe funds, you can limit your risk while still reaping the rewards of high rates of return.",
        "Index funds and mutual funds are good places to start. Essentially collections of dozens or hundreds of different stocks, these funds allow you to spread your money across different investments to limit your risk. That way, if one or a few of the stocks within the fund decrease in value, you won't lose a substantial amount of your investment. While there's still some risk involved (you'll never be able to completely avoid risk with the stock market), your money is still as protected as possible.",
        "Exactly how much of your money you should put toward stocks and which funds you should invest in depend on a few factors, such as your age and how comfortable you are with risk. The younger you are, the more risk you can afford to take on. You'll likely earn higher returns, and if you do experience some losses, you still have decades to recoup your money before you retire. As you get older, you can weight your portfolio more heavily toward safer investments, like bonds, to further limit your risk as you get closer to retirement.",
        "Also, it's not as confusing or difficult as you may think to invest in the stock market. In fact, all you need to do to start investing is start saving in a 401(k) or IRA . With IRAs in particular you have a wealth of investment options to choose from, so no matter how comfortable or uncomfortable you are with risk, there's an option for you. And if you have access to a 401(k) through your employer, you can probably transfer a portion of every paycheck to your retirement fund, which makes investing easy.",
        "This isn't to say savings accounts aren't worthwhile at all. For short-term needs, like building an emergency fund or saving for a down payment on a house, they can be a great way to keep your money safe while still earning a solid interest rate. But for long-term financial goals, investing in the stock market is your best chance to establish a strong, healthy nest egg.",
        "The $16,728 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\r\n If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as\u00a0$16,728 more... each year!

        "By Marcela Ayres and Gabriel Ponte",
        "BRASILIA, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Brazil's government faces another year of strict fiscal discipline, its 2020 budget proposals on Friday showed, as it battles to bring spending under control, shrink the deficit, and gradually move the public accounts closer to balance. ",
        "In order to meet these increasingly difficult challenges, the government will put forward a constitutional amendment to existing budget rules, Waldery Rodrigues, special secretary to the Economy Ministry, said.",
        "Next year will be the seventh consecutive year in which public spending will exceed revenues, severely restricting the government's scope to pay off debt, invest or ease fiscal policy.",
        "As a result, investment spending will fall next year to 19.36 billion reais, the lowest level in at least a decade, from an already historical low of around 27 billion reais this year. Discretionary spending is projected to be 89.3 billion reais",
        "The 2020 budget proposals show the government expects to post a primary deficit, before interest rate payments are taken into account, of 124.1 billion reais ($30 billion), which would follow this year's expected deficit of 139 billion reais.",
        "That will derive from an anticipated social security deficit of 244.2 billion reais, partially compensated for by a 120.1 billion reais surplus at the Treasury and central bank. ",
        "Brazil's nominal budget deficit, which includes interest payments, is much wider and poses a more serious problem, Rodrigues said, adding that he hopes it can be reduced to 5.4% of gross domestic product by 2022 from around 6.5% currently, through asset sales, privatizations and concessions. ",
        "\"Spending must be reduced, and it will be,\" Rodrigues said. \"A better primary balance is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for fiscal balance ... but our biggest concern is with nominal deficit. Our main goal is to improve the nominal balance,\" he added. ",
        "The 2020 budget proposals also note that the government faces a shortfall of 367 billion reais to meet its \"golden rule\" prohibiting the issuance of debt to pay for current spending, which Rodrigues said will be met by a bill seeking supplementary credit. ",
        "Brazil's government expects the economy to grow by 2.17% next year and inflation to come in at 3.91%, the report showed.",

        "By David Shepardson",
        "WASHINGTON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai on Friday sought approval from his colleagues to order the go ahead for  Nexstar Media Group Inc's  acquisition of Tribune Media Co  in a $6.4 billion tie-up, a spokeswoman for the agency said.",
        "Last month, the U.S. Justice Department approved the deal, saying the companies must divest television stations in 13 markets to resolve antitrust concerns. Pai's order circulated Friday needs the consent of a majority of the five-member FCC.",
        "Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc  previously failed to win approval to buy Tribune. Tribune terminated its deal with Sinclair in August 2018, and filed a lawsuit arguing that Sinclair mishandled efforts to get the transaction approved by taking too long and being too aggressive in its dealings with regulators.",
        "Based in Irving, Texas, Nexstar owns, operates and provides sales and other services to 174 television stations reaching nearly 39 percent of all U.S. television households. Nexstar said in March it was selling 19 television stations to Tegna Inc  and E.W. Scripps Co  for $1.3 billion to satisfy regulatory demands before it buys Tribune.",
        "Based in Chicago, Tribune Media owns or operates 42 local television stations reaching approximately 50 million households. Tribune emerged from bankruptcy in late 2012 and completed a spinoff of its newspaper assets in 2014."

      "text": [
        "In the world of energy stocks , green energy investments may be the trickiest to figure out. Since many of these companies are based on emerging technologies or are dependent on economic conditions and public policies that can change rapidly, it can be hard to pick top renewable energy stocks... or, for that matter, even decent ones.",
        "Recognizing the difficulty, however, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to tell us which renewable energy stocks they see as having high potential for investors right now. They came back with SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR) , TPI Composites (NASDAQ: TPIC) , and TerraForm Power (NASDAQ: TERP) . Here's why they think these are worthy of a second look.",
        "Top stocks in the renewable energy industry can light up your portfolio. Image source: Getty Images.",
        "Travis Hoium(SunPower): The solar industry is returning to some semblance of stability: Demand around the world is rising, and manufacturers have been holding back on adding capacity that could put the industry into a state of oversupply. Those trends are providing tailwinds for SunPower, but they're not the only reason I like this renewable energy stock long term .",
        "SunPower's high-efficiency solar panels are perfect for space-constrained home roofs, and that's really the company's bread-and-butter business. Residential solar systems were just 11% of the megawatts of solar panels deployed in the second quarter, but 36% of revenue. That's because residential solar panels sell for a higher price, and are accompanied by high-value components like inverters, racking, and even energy storage.",
        "Over the next few years, SunPower will be upgrading to a manufacturing process that will make larger solar cells, which will cut its costs to be more in line with commodity-level competition. That should help push gross margins from the 8% last quarter to over 20%.",
        "The biggest upside for SunPower will be from the commercial market, where it's the domestic market share leader. Its commercial solar segment is smaller than its residential segment, with 47 GW and $83.4 million in sales last quarter, but the business is growing steadily in the U.S. as companies try to find ways to lower their energy costs and improve their environmental footprints.",
        "SunPower isn't profitable, but it's heading in that direction, and if current trends continue, it could start turning profits by the end of 2019. If that happens, SunPower has a big market to tap, with residential solar leading the way for the foreseeable future.",
        "Rich Smith ( TPI Composites ): Shares of windmill blade-maker TPI Composites crashed hard in August after the company reported an earnings beat -- but also made a big reduction in its guidance. With roughly 40% of its production lines for windmill blades either still spinning up, or in the process of being retooled to produce new models, TPI's currently operating 30% under full capacity.",
        "Which is a curious coincidence -- because its stock is also down 30% since the earnings report .",
        "And yet, due to that big drop in share price, by one measure at least, TPI stock is cheaper to own that it's been in years. It's trading at an enterprise value of just 0.7 times its $1.2 billion in trailing sales, a valuation last seen in March 2018. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence , the company has never closed out a quarter with a valuation this low.",
        "While currently unprofitable, it's promising to more than double its trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ) to more than $80 million by year's end. And by 2022, analysts predict the company will more than triple its annual EBITDA to nearly $300 million. Actual GAAP earnings should follow in short order. From a loss this year, analysts forecast TPI will grow to earn more than $4 a share in just three short years.",
        "If you agree with those estimates, you'd better buy shares now, because TPI Composites stock won't stay this cheap for long.",
        "John Bromels(TerraForm Power) \u00a0Yes, you read that right -- a green energy stock that pays a dividend! Most renewable stocks (including those recommended by my colleagues above) are too young and focused on growth (or just too cash-poor) to swing a dividend. But a handful of them -- mostly renewable yieldcos -- do offer dividends, and TerraForm Power's is one of the best, currently yielding about 4.6%.",
        "Things have changed a lot in recent years for this wind and solar farm operator. It was spun off from the now-defunct SunEdison in 2014 to operate its parent's renewable assets. In 2016, though, SunEdison went bankrupt, sparking a crisis at TerraForm involving debt entanglements, lawsuits, and a suspended dividend. Luckily, the well-managed Brookfield Asset Management stepped in as TerraForm's majority shareholder and sponsor, and the company has experienced a dramatic turnaround.",
        "Since 2016, TerraForm has made progress in reducing its debt load. It also improved its earnings and cash flow through its purchase of Spanish wind and solar company Saeta. Management has targeted an annual dividend increase of 5% to 8% a year through 2022, and looks on track to achieve that goal. The market has been catching on to its successes, though, which is why investors sent its shares up more than 50% over the past year.",
        "While most people don't think of renewable energy and dividends as being compatible, TerraForm looks like a buy for dividend investors and green energy fans alike.",
        "10 stocks we like better than TerraForm Power\r\n When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has quadrupled the market.*",
        "David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and TerraForm Power wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.",

        "Jason Moser: Welcome to Industry Focus , the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market each day. It's Tuesday, Aug. 27. I'm your host, Jason Moser, and on today's Consumer Goods show, we're going to talk about the latest quarter for the Amazon of Africa, Jumia. We're going to talk about Disney and Target tying up a little bit there on the store front. And we're going to go into a little bit more about what the Disney streaming services may hold for consumers.",
        "As always, we will have One to Watch for you for the coming week. And as we get started here, I'd like to thank Mr. Joey Solitro from Motley Fool Canada for joining me in the studio today. Joey, how's it going?",
        "Joey Solitro: It's going great! Thanks for having me!",
        "Moser: Good! Well, thanks for being here! I was excited to get you in here for this week's show, because the first topic for discussion today is a company that you follow closely; you've been following it for a while. You talked about it here on the show a number of months ago. We wanted to go a little bit deeper into it this week, because Jumia jus t report ed earnings recently. It's been a little bit of a tough go as a public company for Jumia thus far. I've talked with you a lot about this company; it sounds exciting. It sounds like there's a tremendous opportunity out there.",
        "Sometimes the stock is a little bit detached from that opportunity, maybe, so you have to be able to look a little bit further down the line here. Given what you know today, going through the most recent quarter and seeing where the stock is today, do you feel like this is more of a geography thing? The market may be needing to take that leap of faith, and it's not ready to take that leap yet? Or, is this more of a business thing? Is Jumia running into some business problems that they're going to have to fix?",
        "Solitro: With Jumia, as for the earnings reports, we saw gross merchandise volume jump over 60%. Revenue followed it, over 50%. When you look at the GMV volume, active consumers jumping 50% year over year, the key metrics are moving in the right direction.",
        "Yes, they're losing more money, but I feel like a lot of what they're doing, and their success years out from now, will be consumers trusting the e-commerce process a lot more. We don't even think about it -- when we buy something online, we know it's going to get to us; we know if it doesn't, we can get our money back. But they don't really have that in Africa. They like the cash on delivery. They don't want their money to leave unless that good is physically in their hands. I think it's a lot of distrust about the process, especially on the payments side. So, as that continues to get more popular and people can trust that, I feel like this company, that's where the success will lay.",
        "Moser: I think that makes sense. It makes me think of...back many, many years ago, when David Gardner had recommended Amazon here at The Fool, back when e-commerce was just becoming a thing. All of the skeptics out there were like: \"There is no way anybody's going to put their credit card number on a website blindly, and just give it away, and let someone just promise they're going to ship them something. Who knows what's going to happen?\" You fast-forward to today, and obviously, that's the only way business seems to be done.",
        "So, I think you're right in that it's a market that's not used to that yet. It does take some getting used to it; it takes a little bit of faith to believe that that process is going to work out. Africa, clearly, [is] an economy that is somewhat behind ours developmentally speaking, but it doesn't mean it can't get to where we are today. Maybe this is one of those steps that'll really help them get there. To your point, it seems like the gross merchandise volume going through that network, that's a tremendous sign, right?",
        "Solitro: I would say so. Africa in general reminds me of China in the late '80s and '90s. Same with the situation in China back then, less than 1% of total retail sales are done online in Africa right now. Where China got over that hump -- and I think that had a lot to do with the rise of companies like Alibaba and JD.com , and people trusting those names and trusting the payments side of that as well -- I feel like if Jumia can establish itself, and establish not only its website but Jumia Pay as the trusted place to go and actually have their payment information stored and be OK with paying for that up front, I feel like that's the driver for them.",
        "Moser: So, trust sounds like a big factor in the equation today. Let's think five years down the line here. We could think 10 years down the line, if you want. But the basic idea here is five years from now, 10 years from now, Jumia is succeeding, it's doing well, it's gaining traction: What's going right? What's been the key for that? Why is it succeeding?",
        "Solitro: I think as their economy continues to grow, I think as more people come into the working class, and as that trust grows for the actual online process, I feel like they're going to be opening more distribution facilities, expanding to more countries. And especially, I think Jumia Pay is in six countries now, and they operate in total in 13 or 14 countries, so expanding it to the rest of those countries.",
        "I think, not even expanding its capabilities online, but I always go back to that trust factor. We don't even second-guess when we purchase something online. But there, you have to think they're not as connected as we are, where we can track a package so easily, know exactly when it's going to be delivered and by who. In most of their cities, you can't even deliver it to a specific address, because they don't have addresses and mailboxes like we do here. It might be that they have to go to a specific drop-off point and actually pick up their package from there. So, I think infrastructure will be a huge thing. Luckily, there's a lot of companies investing in infrastructure over in Africa.",
        "So if it were to fail, I believe they just weren't able to get over those humps, and they weren't able to educate the consumers enough to trust the process, and investors just were not willing to put more money into this company, since they do burn quite a bit of cash and they're likely going to need to raise more capital down the line. It might come to a point where companies and investors just don't want to do that.",
        "Moser: It takes a long view. To your point about some areas where it's not going to be delivered to your house, you had to go pick it up from a fulfillment center: We were in Costa Rica this summer, our family; Amazon, very much the same situation there. In most cases, Amazon was going to be shipped to a central location, and then you would have to make your way to get it. Now, if you've driven around Costa Rica, it's very spread out. Some places you have to go up mountains to get to.",
        "Solitro: They have Amazon lockers.",
        "Moser: Yeah, it's understandable why Amazon packages can't make it to every doorstep. But the investment in that infrastructure will continue to take place. You'll see Amazon lockers all over the place. So, yeah, that's definitely a solution there. It does sound like it's just the ultimate long-term view, though. You've got to be able to look at this thing and say, \"You know what, it's going to take five to 10 years for this thing to really work out.\" But, hey, there could be some real potential upside there.",
        "Solitro: Yeah, I think best-case scenario, you see this playing out in five years. I'm more of...I'm looking 10 years, 25 years out. This is kind of like finding MercadoLibre or Amazon in its infancy.",
        "Moser: Is there a Pepsi[Co] to their [Coca-Cola] ? We always try to talk about that competitor out there that's going to force their hand and keep them innovating. Is there another company doing what Jumia is doing in that market?",
        "Solitro: I know there's one player within Egypt, and I think there's other single-country players. But there's no other player, at least that I've come across, that's in several countries, especially with their reach.",
        "Moser: You've got to go big; you've got to go big early. When you have leadership that knows what they're doing, and they stick with the plan, it can work; it just takes some time to do. I guess we'll have to remain patient. But we'll certainly keep listeners updated here, quarter in and quarter out. Thankfully, we've got Joey here covering the business for us.",
        "Let's pivot over to something a little bit more magical, a little bit more happy: We're talking a lot about Disney these days. We've seen a lot of news in regard to what's coming out on the streaming front for Disney. We're going to talk a little bit about that.",
        "But also, wanted to talk for a minute about what Disney and Target are getting ready to do together. If you read through the Target press release here, then you'll see that essentially, you're going to start seeing Disney Stores in Target. It's going to essentially be a shop-in-a-shop location. It's going to start out with 25 select Target stores in October, 40 more opening by October 2020.",
        "This is going to be something where Target is essentially integrating more of that Disney experience into their stores. Whether it's going to be places where you can go see all of the latest Disney toys, there are going to be certainly some exclusive toys in those areas where you won't be able to get them elsewhere. You'll be able to go see movie clips and whatnot. It does really sound like they're bringing a little bit of that Disney interactive experience into the Target footprint there, into the actual physical store. We've been talking so much here over the past several years about the death of physical retail, but clearly, there are some companies still prospering. Target's certainly one of them.",
        "Solitro: Target is the go-to in my household. You've got The Happiest Place on Earth opening a store within the greatest store on Earth. I have to say, as a father of two daughters and a son on the way, I'm against this in every single way --",
        "Moser: [laughs] Either that or you'd better ask for a raise.",
        "Solitro: [laughs] That's what it comes down to. If Target didn't take enough of our money as it is, now you're going to open up a Disney shop? It's going to be impossible to tear the kids out of that store.",
        "Moser: Well, I was thinking about this, too. I'm father of two daughters. My girls are a little bit older than your kids at this point. But I do remember when they were a lot younger, and it seemed like there was a birthday party every weekend. And in most cases, we were going to Target to grab that birthday present last second. I did find, after a while, the toy section became a little bit wanting. It didn't really have a whole heck of a lot of any one thing. It was just scattered, a little bit of this and a little bit of that. I have to believe that this is going to change that dynamic for the better.",
        "Disney's always been very strong from a consumer-goods perspective. You would see a Disney Store at the mall, and obviously, they sell that stuff all over their parks. But, I think, to bring this store into Target, which is clearly doing well here domestically -- I don't think we're in a position where Target is going to be going away anytime soon. It feels like, to me, it's getting stronger. I feel like this just makes it even stronger. And for Disney, really, I don't see any downside for Disney doing this. Do you?",
        "Solitro: No, definitely not. What gets me excited about this partnership is, Disney is very good at making the most out of small spaces. You go to their parks, some of those stores are very small, but they're pumping thousands, if not millions of people through there each day. So, I can only imagine what they're going to do with a couple of hundred square feet. I don't know how big these stores are going to be at this Target. I know there's one like an hour and 10 minutes from my house that I was actually wanting to go see, because it's one of the 25 stores. I think it's Leesburg, Virginia. It's definitely going to be exciting to see. I've had the same experience with the different toy sections of Target -- it's scattered all over the place. I feel like Disney is going to be pulling in all of their specific brands that were already within Target, and making more of an experience within a Target store.",
        "Moser: Yeah. We talk about it a lot with these physical retailers. The key is driving traffic, figuring out any way that you can drive traffic, because there are those big fixed expenses that come with running a store. You pay that rent no matter what. You pay for the store to be open no matter what. So the more traffic you can push through those stores, then the more profitability you're going to see. You start to see some of that operating leverage play out.",
        "And we see, quarter in and quarter out with Disney itself from the parks side, they're really good at demonstrating the power of that operating leverage. The parks have the same thing, essentially, as a retail store: You have to pay a lot of money to keep them open. So they want to drive as many people through there as they can. This seems like a great bet on engagement. I have to believe there's going to be some word of mouth. People are going to say, \"That's pretty cool.\" They're going to go back. Maybe even, if it's a rainy day and you're looking for something to take the kids to go do for a few minutes that gets them out of the house. I can certainly see it spreading beyond just these 60 stores they're talking about here, and getting this thing started.",
        "That takes us into the other story here with Disney, that to me it seems like every day is just becoming more and more impressive, what they're doing on this streaming front here. With Disney+ getting ready to hit the market here Nov. 12, [the] Disney+ streaming service is going to become available for consumers. They're going to charge $6.99 a month just for the Disney+. Now, if you do the bundle of Disney+, and ESPN+, and Hulu ad-supported, you get that for like $12.99. Again, to me, that bundle sounds like a no-brainer.",
        "But given what we saw here recently at the D23 Expo, with all of the content that they rolled out, my Twitter feed didn't stop for like the whole day. It was something else. My daughters were pinging me about cool stuff that's coming out. I'm looking at some stuff that's coming out. The Mandalorian ? I'm looking forward to seeing that. What struck me: Just a tip of the cap to the executive that came up with the idea of letting people go ahead and sign up in advance for the service at this D23 Expo. Apparently, that drove a lot of people to go ahead and sign up for a streaming service that isn't even live yet.",
        "Solitro: Had they let us sign up the day it was announced, my family would have been signed up. The price point alone is just a no-brainer for any parent. I've got an almost-four-year-old, an almost-two-year-old, and a son being born in January, so I will likely be a customer of this Disney streaming service for the next, at least, 12 [to] 15 years. I don't know how long they're watching these days. But on top of that, the content they even have for adults with the Marvel Universe -- this is going to be a major player almost overnight.",
        "Moser: Yeah. My girls are 13 and 14, and they're even still kind of excited about the stuff that's coming out. They've done a good job of giving a little bit of something for everyone there. One thing you mentioned, and I wanted to dig into this a little, in regard to the Marvel Universe, the superhero universe and all that content that has done so well for Disney for so long -- and not only Disney.",
        "Really, if you think about a lot of this Marvel content, Disney is one of the first names that comes to mind. But really, so is Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) , because Netflix for a long time really has capitalized on bringing a lot of that content into their universe. It seemed to me, at least, that's what Netflix is really known well for, was having a lot of that cool superhero content and Marvel stuff that people really enjoyed. Essentially all of that content is going to be disappearing. It's not going to happen overnight. But that's stuff that Netflix isn't going to get back. We talked about this before, the challenges that Netflix may witness from something like this. And it's not just Netflix -- other streaming services, of course. But I think Netflix is in a little bit of a unique situation there. They've been paying an arm and a leg for a lot of content; I'm not sure how much farther they can raise prices. What do you think about their competitive position today, in relation to what Disney's getting ready to launch?",
        "Solitro: Yeah, Netflix, they definitely have problems ahead of them. I think they're going to have to develop a lot more original content. I remember when I first signed up, they had House of Cards as a go-to. Orange Is the New Black got pretty popular. But The Office is still probably what we watch the most. With them losing specific brands, losing this Marvel Universe of films, I feel like Netflix is definitely going to have to put out more movies like Bird Box or these one-offs.",
        "That was the other angle I was thinking that Disney could take. If they take one of these Marvel movies that grosses $1 billion and says, \"Hey, we're going to release it exclusively onto Disney+,\" I imagine they'd have a couple of hundred million people signing up overnight just to see the release of that film. So, if any company can launch into streaming and be an overnight success, my money's on Disney.",
        "Moser: Yeah. They've proven time and time again, they are masters of taking one story and then spinning a lot of other stories from that story. I expect them to keep doing that. You have to love this opening price point at $6.99. It's way underpriced. It's tremendous value. I just would argue that until the cows come home. But that's going to give them a lot of room to raise prices down the road.",
        "Solitro: Oh, absolutely! I thought that this was going to be more like $19.99 or $15, something like that. When they announced $6.99, I thought it was a typo, like they forgot one in front of the six. That's when I labeled this an absolute no-brainer for any parent to be signing up on this. And they could easily raise prices. You look at how often they raise ticket prices at their parks: Now I have to almost take out a second mortgage to take the family. I lived in Florida for a long time; that's one expense that got cut when I moved up here to Virginia. But I can only imagine with how they like to raise prices, how they'll handle their Disney+ streaming. You had mentioned to me where you're able to lock in a three-year, pay up front? Dear Disney, please offer a 10-year plan. Let me get that. Give me a discount. Lock me in long-term.",
        "Moser: They're astute businesspeople there. I'm sure they probably kicked that idea around. Like I said, I think we'll be watching some of that stuff even long after our kids leave the house. Again, it seems like they're using this Disney+ platform as a way to get content for adults and kids and everyone in between. That's the most encouraging thing. And so yeah, it's going to be fascinating to watch how this plays out.",
        "And I have to believe, at some point somewhere, Bob Iger was sitting in that boardroom thinking, \"Yeah, we're going to price the thing at $6.99 and see if Reed Hastings wants to squirm a little bit with this price point,\" because I think even he knows that it's getting more competitive. It's certainly not to take anything away from Reed Hastings and Netflix. Again, I think that's one of the core streaming platforms that everyone's going to continue to have. It just makes you wonder how much they can raise prices, and what they're going to do on the content side. And hey, it's not to say that down the road, you won't see collaboration from those two powerhouses either. In a lot of cases, whether it's Disney teaming up with Target or whether it's Disney teaming up with toymakers, it's always nice to see two powerhouse companies partner together. We've seen great results from Disney and Netflix partnering before. It's not to say that can't happen again. But this is going to be a fun one to watch play out.",
        "Before we wrap up here, let's just jump in really quick to a couple of stocks to keep on our listeners' radars this week. We've got Ones to Watch for you. Joey, what's the stock you are watching this week?",
        "Solitro: I've been watching Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) , PINS, lately. They had a fantastic earnings report. They had an over 60% jump in revenue. Monthly active users hit 300 million, which was a 30% increase year over year. And the average revenue per user is still less than $1 globally. I feel like with the growing number of monthly active users, and how people that use Pinterest actually have an intention to make a purchase, is where advertisers are just going to be falling over themselves to increase spend on this platform. I look at the market cap, I think it's around $20 billion, maybe even under that: I just see a major, major growth runway in front of these guys, and a clear path to profitability, that this could just be a massive company. I initiated a stake right after they came public, and this is one I'm just really excited about.",
        "Moser: Cool. And the ticker?",
        "Solitro: PINS.",
        "Moser: OK. I'm going to be keeping an eye on Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) , ETSY. You and I talk about Etsy a lot here at work. It's becoming, I think, a stock a lot of our analyst team is really becoming fond of, and for a lot of good reasons. Talk abou t earnings reports that were really impressive. The second-quarter earnings report came out for Etsy. It was another good one. Active sellers grew to over 2.3 million. Active buyers, better than 42.7 million. The network pushed through almost $1.1 billion in gross merchandise sales. Revenue up 37%. Earnings per share continued to grow. Gross margin was up.",
        "This is a company that's really just identified a niche in that craft market, and it's become the go-to trusted network in that market. That's really what the business is. It's a network connecting buyers and sellers for craft goods. It maintains a fairly light balance sheet, which is nice. And to top it off, you have a leader, a CEO, in Josh Silverman who just is so forward-thinking and so in touch with, I think, the retail space. He has a perspective there on the retail space that I don't think a lot of others really have, and I think that's really benefited the business. It's one I personally own. I added a few more shares after this most recen t earnings report . We'll continue to dig into it here. Ticker here is ETSY.",
        "So, Pinterest and Etsy, guys. Keep eyes out on those stocks this week and beyond.",

      "title": "Green Thumb Industries' Q2 Beats on Revenue, Misses on the Bottom Line - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "Marijuana stockGreen Thumb Industries (OTC: GTBIF) has reported Q2 fiscal 2019 results. Its $44.7 million in revenue was almost 230% higher on a year-over-year basis. On the bottom line, however, Green Thumb flipped to a loss of $22.2 million ($0.12 per share) from the year-ago profit of almost $393,000.",
        "Although the revenue figure trounced the average analyst estimate of $36.4 million, expectations were for a net loss of only $0.04 per share.",
        "Image source: Rise Cannabis (Green Thumb Industries).",
        "The stark difference in the bottom-line result derives from increased debt expenditures, and a variable note receivable held by the company that hurt the \"other income/expenses\" line item.",
        "As with other ambitious cannabis companies, Green Thumb is aiming to enlarge its footprint. This can be costly: In Q2, the company's interest expense rocketed to almost $6.2 million, from just under $467,000 in Q2 2018. Some of its debt is quite recent -- for example, a $105.5 million flotation of senior secured notes that closed during the quarter. Those notes mature in 2022, and bear rather costly annual interest of 12%.",
        "But some pundits believe its acquisitions are well considered , with very good potential for helping its fundamentals. A recent one is the company's purchase of Fiorello Pharmaceuticals. This New York-based producer and retailer is one of only 10 entities in that large and populous state that are permitted to operate a medical marijuana company.

      "title": "As Dorian nears, Florida nursing homes face heat for lacking generators - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "By Scott Malone",
        "Aug 30 (Reuters) - One in five Florida nursing homes on Friday were counting on temporary generators to be delivered before Hurricane Dorian hits, according to the state agency charged with ensuring their residents will have air conditioning if power is knocked out.",
        "The state legislature passed the law requiring generators after a dozen people died in a sweltering nursing home after 2017's Hurricane Irma. State officials are also racing to check some 120 nursing homes and assisted living facilities where they are unsure if generators or contingency plans are in place, Governor Ron DeSantis told a news conference.",
        "Generators are an urgent matter in Florida, an aging state where some 190,000 people live in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. DeSantis' predecessor, Rick Scott, signed the March 2018 law requiring nursing homes to be able to keep temperatures at or below 81 degrees Fahrenheit (27\u00b0C) for at least 72 hours after losing power.",
        "The law followed problems in the wake of 2017's Hurricane Irma, which knocked out electricity to a wide swath of the state. This week, police in Hollywood, Florida, charged four nursing home employees with causing the deaths of 12 patients in the sweltering heat of a power outage that followed Irma. ",
        "\"There are going to be site checks, there are going to be phone calls to make sure that they have a plan to deal with folks that are in their care,\" DeSantis said.",
        "State data shows just 41.8% of Florida's 687 nursing homes have permanent generators in place, with 36.4% having temporary generators on site. Some 21.4%, or 147 nursing homes with beds for 17,754 people, have arrangements to have temporary generators delivered if they lose power, while three with the capacity to house a total 338 people, would evacuate if they lose power.",
        "The picture is brighter among the state's 3,061 assisted-living facilities, which can house 106,086 people. Fully 94.3% of those sites have permanent generators in place, according to Florida'sAgency for Health Care Administration.",
        "State legislative records, however, show hundreds of nursing homes have received waivers allowing them to operate with temporary generators, even though the 2018 law intended for all sites to have permanent generators by the start of last year's hurricane season.",
        "\"There are tens of thousands, multiple tens of thousands of people whose safety could be at risk in this situation. And we've had two years to prepare for this,\" said Dave Bruns, a spokesman for the Florida chapter of AARP, a group representing Americans aged 50 and over, in a phone interview. \"That we find ourselves in this situation is disappointing.\"",
        "The state AHCS agency, which oversees nursing home and assisted-living facilities in the state, said it was working to ensure that all those sites complied with the law.",
        "\"Our agency remains committed to making sure long term care facilities can support safe conditions during loss of power,\" AHCA Secretary Mary Mayhew said in a statement.",
        "Many of the state's larger nursing homes are as much as 30 years old, meaning that installing generators can take extensive regulatory review as well as potentially replacing entire electrical systems, said Kristen Knapp, a spokeswoman for the Florida Health Care Association, which represents about 80 percent of the state's nursing homes.",
        "\"These aren't generators that you go to Home Depot and purchase and plug in,\" Knapp said. She added that following the declaration of a state of emergency, nursing home operators had 24 hours to get their temporary generators delivered: \"Ideally, those generators are all going to be in place before Dorian even makes landfall.\""

      "title": "3 Personal Loan Scams to Avoid - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "\r\n Don't fall for these crafty tricks.",
        "Image source: Getty Images",
        "When shopping for a personal loan , you probably focus on interest rates, fees, and repayment terms. But there's one thing that's more important than all of them -- making sure you're dealing with a legitimate company. Scammers often pose as personal loan providers to trick those in need of money into giving up their cash instead.",
        "They're not always easy to spot because many of them sound convincing, but by understanding the most common types of scams and their warning signs, you can avoid becoming another of their victims. Here are three of the most common personal loan scams you might come across.",
        "No-credit-check loans are appealing to borrowers with poor credit who may struggle to secure loans with legitimate companies. Some are so relieved to find a company willing to work with them without asking any questions about their past that they don't do their due diligence before signing up. It is only after they hand over their personal information and possibly some fees to the scammer and never receive the funds they were promised that they realize their mistake.",
        "All lenders assess your credit when you apply for a loan. It's essential because it tells the lender how responsible you are with your money and how likely you are to pay back what you borrow. Lenders may charge higher rates to or refuse to work with borrowers with poor credit because there's a greater risk that they won't get their money back. And without any collateral, that money is probably gone for good.",
        "Some legitimate lenders work with borrowers with poor credit, but they still run a credit check and use it to determine your interest rate. If you come across a lender offering a personal loan with no credit check, avoid it. Try applying for a secured credit card instead or work on improving your credit by making regular, on-time payments and keeping your credit card usage low. Then reapply for the loan again when your credit improves.",
        "Legitimate personal loan providers charge origination fees, which are a small percentage of your loan balance. But these fees are paid out of the loan amount so you don't actually get the full amount you borrowed, but you also don't have to write the lender a check in order to receive your funds.",
        "Some scammers capitalize on the fact that not everyone knows this by requesting victims send in money as an origination, application, or processing fee before the \"lender\" will release their funds to them. What actually happens is that the scammer takes the money you give them and disappears before you realize what happened.",
        "You may receive legitimate personal loan offers through the mail, especially if you've applied for a personal loan in the past. But scammers may also throw their letters into the mix in the hope that you'll mistake them for a real company. They may also reach out to you via phone or email and gutsy scammers may even show up at your door to sell the lie.",
        "No real personal loan companies will attempt to contact you in these ways with unsolicited offers, so that's a pretty sure sign of a scam. But other things to watch for are links to fake websites, requests for personal information, high-pressure sales tactics, and grammatical and spelling errors in any documents you receive.",
        "If a personal loan offer sets off alarm bells in your head, there's probably a good reason for it. Don't hand over any money or personal information to the company until you've taken steps to verify the company's reputation.",
        "First, check if the company is registered to do business in your state by contacting your state attorney general's office. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires all legitimate lenders to be licensed in every state where they conduct business, so if it's unlicensed in your state, that's a sure sign you're dealing with a scam.",
        "You should also check out the company's website. All websites that request financial information should be secured to prevent hackers from stealing it. You can tell if a site is legitimate by looking for \"https\" at the start of its URL. If the \"s\" is missing, that's a sign the company isn't taking steps to protect your financial information and you shouldn't work with them.",
        "Run a search for the company online as well to see if any negative information shows up and try to track down an address for the company. A missing address is another red flag. Some scammers may pretend they work with a legitimate company, so compare the emails, websites, and phone numbers the scammer gives you with the ones that come up during your internet search.",
        "If you do come across a scam, report the company to the FTC , your state attorney general's office, and your local police. Give them as much information as you can about the scammer, including the name they went by, the phone number they used, and copies of any correspondence you received from them. This will help these agencies track down the scammer and prevent them from hurting others in the future.",
        "If you're a victim of a personal loan scam, you should still report the scammer to the agencies listed above. Some people are reluctant to admit to having fallen for a scam. But refusing to report it leaves thousands of other people at risk of falling for the same trap.",
        "You also need to protect your other financial information if you gave any of it to the scammer. Pull your credi t report s and check for any unusual accounts or activity you don't recognize. If you see any, notify the financial institution and the credit bureau and put a fraud alert on your account so that lenders know to take extra steps to verify your identity before opening a new credit account in your name.",
        "You may not get your money back, but you can avoid losing even more money by taking the above steps. Personal loan scammers are never going to rest, but if you're wise to their tricks, you can keep yourself and maybe even your family and friends from suffering a financial loss at their hands.",

      "text": [
        "  Apple is touting\u00a0its\u00a0recently launched Apple     Card\u00a0as\u00a0another in a long line of     innovations,\u00a0claiming it \"completely rethinks everything     about the credit card.\"\u00a0But that's a bit of an     overstatement. While the Apple Card does boast some compelling attributes,     perhaps\u00a0the most innovative thing about it is that it     combines several hard-to-find - but not unprecedented -     features into a single package. \"We need to keep in mind that this is simply a credit card,\"     says Brian Riley, director of the credit advisory service for     Mercator Advisory Group, a payments and banking industry     consulting group, via email. Noting that\u00a0the Apple     Card\u00a0will be competing against some well-established     issuers, including Chase and American Express, he says it will     be \"a case study in loyalty. Will the masses follow Apple?\"makeArticleAd(); If you're tempted to take the Apple Card plunge, here's how     to separate the helpful features from the hype.  \u00bb MORE: Should you get the Apple Card?  No, the Apple Card doesn't 'completely rethink     everything' The\u00a0Apple Card doesn't\u00a0so much break new ground as     consolidate it. Unlike many other\u00a0cash-back credit cards, this one is     clearly designed for mobile-first users. In fact, the only way     you can apply for\u00a0the Apple Card is via an eligible     iPhone, which is unique (if also a potential roadblock). \"As with all Apple products, there is indeed an elegance to     it,\" Riley says. But virtually any credit card can be added to a\u00a0mobile     wallet\u00a0and used the same way. The\u00a0Apple Card does incentivize the use of a mobile     wallet,\u00a0earning\u00a0the following rewards:  When used with Apple Pay:   3% back on purchases made directly with Apple, including       at Apple stores, within the App Store and for Apple       services. 3% back at\u00a0select merchants and through select apps.       When the card officially launched in August 2019,       Apple\u00a0noted Uber and Uber Eats would be among the       3%\u00a0categories\u00a0and\u00a0indicated\u00a0that others       might be coming. 2% back on all other purchases made through Apple       Pay.   When used as a physical card:   1% back on all purchases.  But\u00a0many     Apple Card competitors      \u00a0earn similar rates or\u00a0higher without     requiring      \u00a0that you use a mobile wallet to\u00a0get\u00a0them. And about that physical, \"laser-etched titanium\" card, which     you must request separately? Its rewards rate just\u00a0isn't     competitive today. When it comes to fees, the\u00a0Apple Card trumpets its lack     of them - but\u00a0you can find any number of cash-back cards     that similarly charge neither an annual fee nor     any\u00a0\"over-the-limit\" fees,\u00a0which have been extinct     for years. More interesting is the Apple Card's lack of foreign     transaction fees\u00a0or late fees.\u00a0It's harder (though     not impossible) to find cash-back cards that don't charge a fee     for purchases abroad; other cards already waive late fees,     although typically those\u00a0products don't earn rewards. So\u00a0what is new about the Apple Card? The Apple Card did rethink - that is, it opted against -     offering a sign-up bonus, a 0% intro APR period or the ability     to add authorized users, all of which are common     features\u00a0of its competitors. The inability to add an authorized user \"means\u00a0that     some households won't be able to manage their overall credit     card spend or outstanding balance on a single card,\" says Jim     Miller, vice president of banking and credit cards for J.D.     Power. But it's certainly not all bad news. The\u00a0Apple Card     does bring\u00a0some\u00a0truly\u00a0fresh\u00a0offerings to     the table:   You can see\u00a0your credit limit and APR before       committing to the card.        \u00a0If approved for the card, you can decide - based       on\u00a0the\u00a0credit limit and APR you're offered -       whether you want to accept the deal. Apple says you'll have       up to 30 days to\u00a0make your decision\u00a0and that       \"your\u00a0credit score is not affected until after you       accept.\" You'll be hard-pressed to find another card       that\u00a0shows you this information       before        \u00a0pulling your credit.  You have access to 24/7 text-message-based customer       support.        \u00a0Round-the-clock customer service isn't new, but       carrying on a conversation with the issuer via text is novel,       and ideal if you loathe phone calls and long hold times. (You       can also call through the iPhone Wallet app.)  Use Apple Maps to help clarify your       purchases.        You can tap on individual charges you make with the card to       pinpoint that merchant's location on your iPhone's Apple Maps       app.  And what is\u00a0just rare or interesting?   You get instant access to\u00a0your card upon       approval.        Start making purchases immediately, with no\u00a0need to wait       days before receiving a physical card in the mail.       Instant credit access        \u00a0is uncommon, but not new.  You can accrue (and spend) rewards in real       time.        \u00a0There's no minimum redemption amount and no waiting       until the billing cycle is over to access your stash. These       features are welcome, but available elsewhere.  You\u00a0can access financial tools to help you break       down and categorize your spending.        \u00a0Helpful, but available via many other credit cards and       third-party sites, NerdWallet included. Still, \"for somebody       that may not have done a budget before and (may) not know       where their money is going, it could be an eye-opener,\" says       Luis F. Rosa, CFP and founder of\u00a0Build a Better       Financial Future, a financial planning firm. One drawback:       Downloading your transaction history to Mint or similar       financial apps is not supported.  Instant card replacement:        \u00a0If you suspect your Apple Card might have been       compromised, you can generate a new card number and       invalidate your old one, all within the Wallet app. This is       nifty and can save time, but other cards offer free overnight       card replacement and/or the ability to \"freeze\" or \"lock\" a       misplaced card.

Will the masses follow Apple?\"makeArticleAd(); If you're tempted to take the Apple Card plunge, here's how     to separate the helpful features from the hype.  \u00bb MORE: Should you get the Apple Card?  No, the Apple Card doesn't 'completely rethink     everything' The\u00a0Apple Card doesn't\u00a0so much break new ground as     consolidate it. Unlike many other\u00a0cash-back credit cards, this one is     clearly designed for mobile-first users. In fact, the only way     you can apply for\u00a0the Apple Card is via an eligible     iPhone, which is unique (if also a potential roadblock). \"As with all Apple products, there is indeed an elegance to     it,\" Riley says. But virtually any credit card can be added to a\u00a0mobile     wallet\u00a0and used the same way. The\u00a0Apple Card does incentivize the use of a mobile     wallet,\u00a0earning\u00a0the following rewards:  When used with Apple Pay:   3% back on purchases made directly with Apple, including       at Apple stores, within the App Store and for Apple       services. 3% back at\u00a0select merchants and through select apps.       When the card officially launched in August 2019,       Apple\u00a0noted Uber and Uber Eats would be among the       3%\u00a0categories\u00a0and\u00a0indicated\u00a0that others       might be coming. 2% back on all other purchases made through Apple       Pay.   When used as a physical card:   1% back on all purchases.  But\u00a0many     Apple Card competitors      \u00a0earn similar rates or\u00a0higher without     requiring      \u00a0that you use a mobile wallet to\u00a0get\u00a0them. And about that physical, \"laser-etched titanium\" card, which     you must request separately? Its rewards rate just\u00a0isn't     competitive today. When it comes to fees, the\u00a0Apple Card trumpets its lack     of them - but\u00a0you can find any number of cash-back cards     that similarly charge neither an annual fee nor     any\u00a0\"over-the-limit\" fees,\u00a0which have been extinct     for years. More interesting is the Apple Card's lack of foreign     transaction fees\u00a0or late fees.\u00a0It's harder (though     not impossible) to find cash-back cards that don't charge a fee     for purchases abroad; other cards already waive late fees,     although typically those\u00a0products don't earn rewards. So\u00a0what is new about the Apple Card? The Apple Card did rethink - that is, it opted against -     offering a sign-up bonus, a 0% intro APR period or the ability     to add authorized users, all of which are common     features\u00a0of its competitors. The inability to add an authorized user \"means\u00a0that     some households won't be able to manage their overall credit     card spend or outstanding balance on a single card,\" says Jim     Miller, vice president of banking and credit cards for J.D.     Power. But it's certainly not all bad news. The\u00a0Apple Card     does bring\u00a0some\u00a0truly\u00a0fresh\u00a0offerings to     the table:   You can see\u00a0your credit limit and APR before       committing to the card.        \u00a0If approved for the card, you can decide - based       on\u00a0the\u00a0credit limit and APR you're offered -       whether you want to accept the deal. Apple says you'll have       up to 30 days to\u00a0make your decision\u00a0and that       \"your\u00a0credit score is not affected until after you       accept.\" You'll be hard-pressed to find another card       that\u00a0shows you this information       before        \u00a0pulling your credit.  You have access to 24/7 text-message-based customer       support.        \u00a0Round-the-clock customer service isn't new, but       carrying on a conversation with the issuer via text is novel,       and ideal if you loathe phone calls and long hold times. (You       can also call through the iPhone Wallet app.)  Use Apple Maps to help clarify your       purchases.        You can tap on individual charges you make with the card to       pinpoint that merchant's location on your iPhone's Apple Maps       app.  And what is\u00a0just rare or interesting?   You get instant access to\u00a0your card upon       approval.        Start making purchases immediately, with no\u00a0need to wait       days before receiving a physical card in the mail.       Instant credit access        \u00a0is uncommon, but not new.  You can accrue (and spend) rewards in real       time.        \u00a0There's no minimum redemption amount and no waiting       until the billing cycle is over to access your stash. These       features are welcome, but available elsewhere.  You\u00a0can access financial tools to help you break       down and categorize your spending.        \u00a0Helpful, but available via many other credit cards and       third-party sites, NerdWallet included. Still, \"for somebody       that may not have done a budget before and (may) not know       where their money is going, it could be an eye-opener,\" says       Luis F. Rosa, CFP and founder of\u00a0Build a Better       Financial Future, a financial planning firm. One drawback:       Downloading your transaction history to Mint or similar       financial apps is not supported.  Instant card replacement:        \u00a0If you suspect your Apple Card might have been       compromised, you can generate a new card number and       invalidate your old one, all within the Wallet app. This is       nifty and can save time, but other cards offer free overnight       card replacement and/or the ability to \"freeze\" or \"lock\" a       misplaced card. The Apple Card\u00a0claims to       take\u00a0security a step further,\u00a0instituting       additional privacy measures so that Apple can't tell where       you shopped, what you bought or how much you spent.

        "Friday was a relatively quiet day on Wall Street, with major indexes staying relatively close to where they began the session. Investors are getting conflicting readings on the prospects for economic growth going forward, with some signs pointing to continued strength while others call for caution. Despite the relatively calm market, some stocks suffered significant losses. American Outdoor Brands (NASDAQ: AOBC) , Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE: IIPR) , and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ALXN) were among the worst performers. Here's why they did so poorly.",
        "Shares of American Outdoor Brands plunged 22% after the maker of firearms and outdoor equipmen t report ed disappointing fiscal first-quarter financial results. Revenue fell 11% from the previous year's period, sending adjusted net income down by more than 80%. CEO James Debney pointed to \"ongoing softness in the firearms market\" that put downward pressure on the company's sales, but efforts to diversify American Outdoor Brands' business continued to gain momentum. Even so, the company has a significant supply chain in China, and so it'll be hard for it to avoid tariff impacts without taking more dramatic and potentially costly action.",
        "Image source: American Outdoor Brands.",
        "Innovative Industrial Properties saw its shares lose 12% on a tough day for many marijuana stocks . The cannabis-property real estate investment trust didn't make any direct announcements, but it's possible that the drop is connected to a recent shelf registration statement that became effective late Wednesday. Innovative Industrial has routinely done stock offerings to raise capital, and two weeks ago, the company filed to register $250 million in securities for future sale. Although more specific disclosures will be necessary to sell stock under the statement, it may be that investors are anticipating the dilution that would result from future offerings -- especially given the extensive investments Innovative Industrial has made in its business lately.",
        "Finally, shares of Alexion Pharmaceuticals fell 10%. The drugmaker faced a challenge from Amgen , which wants to offer a biosimilar version of Alexion's top-selling Soliris treatment. Soliris treats a wide variety of rare diseases, and it's been the key to the company's success . Yet despite Alexion having multiple patents on Soliris, Amgen wants to have those protections invalidated. Somewhat surprisingly, officials at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office agreed to review the matter. Alexion hasn't lost yet, but even the need to defend itself came as a shock, and investors are afraid about even a chance of defeat and its impact on Soliris sales.",

The past month has been extremely volatile, and it wasn't a surprise to see only small moves for most major benchmarks after a strong rebound earlier in the week. Some stocks had big gains in the wake of company-specific news. Ambarella (NASDAQ: AMBA) , MSG Networks (NYSE: MSGN) , and Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) were among the top performers. Here's why they did so well.",
        "Shares of Ambarella climbed 18% after the video sensor chip manufacturer reported encouraging second-quarter financial results. Both sales and adjusted net income fell from year-earlier levels, but the unfavorable cyclical pressures throughout the semiconductor industry made that unsurprising, and Ambarella's numbers looked a lot better than many investors had feared. Guidance for the current quarter was also encouraging. Even though Ambarella still has to deal with tough conditions and an uncertain geopolitical environment, shareholders are starting to believe in a turnaround for the chipmaker.",

The sports entertainment specialist said it would use a modified Dutch auction tender offer to buy as much as $250 million in stock, at prices ranging from $15 to $17.50 per share. That would represent more than 20% of its current market capitalization, but CEO Andrea Greenberg said that the company \"has a strong balance sheet and generates robust cash flow\" to justify the move. Given the difficulties the sports media company has seen , MSG Networks hopes that it's buying in at a bargain price.",
        "Finally, shares of Dell Technologies finished higher by 10%. The computer giant \u00a0posted a 2% rise in revenue in the second quarter, with adjusted net income soaring almost 40% from year-earlier levels. Strong performance in the client solutions group showed continuing demand for hardware, with double-digit percentage growth in notebook, desktop, and workstation computers. Moreover, despite some challenges in the infrastructure solutions division, Dell Vice Chairman Jeff Clarke believes that \"we are in the early stages of a technology-led investment cycle.\" If customers keep paying for tech improvements, Dell will remain in a good position to benefit.",

Hollub seemed tenaciously set on acquiring Anadarko at all costs.",

On top of that, Occidental already has $11 billion in debt, and that's before Warren Buffett's $10 billion, 8% interest loan. Occidental basically bought something its own size when it didn't have the cash to do so. Their stock price is suffering from it. It has fallen around 40% since Occidental first offered to buy Anadarko and now sits at a 12-year low. Occidental would argue that the price was worth it to create the largest, most dominate, Permian Exploration and Production (E&P) behemoth the world has ever seen. Occidental has no shortage of vigor, but it remains to be seen if the financials can hold up.",

The company is able to sustain a dividend on par with BP\u00a0and Shell, all the while keeping an 8.3 PE and maintaining a payout ratio substantially lower than BP or Shell.

        " A Bloomberg Economics  gauge assessing the earliest available indicators\u00a0recently showed a persistent slump in China's economic growth due to tough external conditions as well as weakening domestics market in August. Escalating trade tensions with the United States  and a slowing global economy are impeding China's economic growth. However, the official Purchasing Manager Index reading is yet to be released  . Meanwhile, analysts are of the opinion that the figures for August will disappoint given the unsatisfactory industrial growth in July  (read: China's Industrials Growth at 17-Year Low: ETFs in Focus  ).  Factors Behind the Downside  The  trade war with United States   has been affecting China's economy.  Responding to President Trump's early August attack, China imposed new tariffs  of 5% to 10% on $75 billion worth of goods from the United States, effective on some items from Sep 1 and others from Dec 15. The raised duties will be levied on nearly 5,078 U.S. products  , including agricultural goods like soybeans and coffee along with whiskey, seafood, aircraft and crude oil. Moreover, effective Dec 15  , China has decided to reinstate a 25% tariff on U.S. automobiles or 5% on auto parts  (read: 4 Dividend ETFs to Ride Out Trade War Uncertainty  ). Baffled by the Chinese retaliation, Trump responded by raising tariffs on $550 billion worth  of Chinese goods.\u00a0He lifted existing tariffsto 30% from 25% on $250 billion of Chinese imports effective Oct 1  . Moreover, tariffs planned on a further $300 billion in Chinese goods will be revised to 15% from 10%  in two stages - Sep 1 and Dec 15. A  slowdown in global economic growth   is being observed with Trump making rampant attacks to defend his America First agenda. Japan has seen a decline in export levels with July marking the eighth month of decrease  . Meanwhile, the U.K. economy disappointed in the second quarter for the first time since late 2012, with GDP declining 0.2%.  Adding to the disappointment, Germany's industrial production  witnessed the steepest annual slump in nine years. Per London-based World Economics Ltd  , Chinese business conditions as reported by sales managers  have touched the lowest point in more than six years   . Contracting profit margins  , low business confidence and slowing growth of markets and sales are making the situation worse.  Is the Picture All Dull?  Per Standard Chartered Plc economists  , China's index of small businesses rose to 54.5 in August from 53.8 in July.\u00a0The country witnessed strength in domestic demand  largely backed by the administration's pro-growth measures.  China's Attempt to Lift Economy  Beijing recently rolled out a key rate reform to\u00a0 lower funding costs for firms\u00a0  in order to lend support to China's struggling economy. As a result of the new policy, banks must fix rates on new loans by mainly referring to the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) and use LPR as the benchmark for\u00a0 setting floating lending rates  (read: Global Stimulus & Huawei Relief Boost Markets: ETFs in Focus  ).

      "text": [
        " President Trump recently announced reaching a trade deal with Japan \"in principal\" on the second day of the G7 meeting held in France  (read: ETFs in Focus on Japan's Dull Preliminary Manufacturing Data  ).  The Backdrop  Since Trump took over as the President, he has been criticizing America's trade imbalances with certain countries, Japan being one. Investors should note that Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. economy rose\u00a0 8.4% from January to July 2019.  Trump has been trying to revitalize the agricultural sector, which has been massively hit by his\u00a0 America first propaganda  . Japan is a very large market for U.S.\u00a0 agricultural exporters  . In 2018, the United States exported around\u00a0 $13 billion\u00a0\u00a0  worth of agricultural products to Japan, which stood out to be the third-largest agricultural export market. U.S. farmers have been facing disadvantages and competitive pressure since Trump opted out of the\u00a0 Trans-Pacific Partnership  (TPP). In return, Japan has been bargaining with the United States to lower the 2.5% tariff on cars and\u00a0 25% tariff on trucks  . Notably, the United States is a very important market for Japan's\u00a0 automobiles and parts.  \u00a0In 2018, the export of motor vehicles and parts to the United States amounted to\u00a0 $56 billion, out of the $68-billion\u00a0  bilateral trade deficit\u00a0the United States had with Japan (read: Trade War Gets Uglier: Here Are the ETF Winners & Losers  ).  Bargain Points Met for Trump & Abe?  The proposed trade deal has been largely applauded by America's agricultural sector  . Japan has agreed to lower tariffs on U.S. agricultural products such as as beef, pork, wheat and dairy products to bring them on par with the existing tariff levels in the revised TPP  . For instance, U.S. beef exporters currently\u00a0 see a tariff of 38.5%\u00a0  in Japan in comparison to 26.6% seen by their Australia, Canada and New Zealand counterparts as of April 2019. The tariffs on beef for the \u00a0revised TPP members will come down to 9% over\u00a0 a 16-year period  . Japan has also agreed to import around 2.5 million tons of surplus corn\u00a0  from the United States. It is worth noting here that in 2018, Japan stood out as the second-largest purchaser  of U.S. corn. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has not agreed to lower the 2.5% tariff on Japanese automobiles  but the discussion on it may continue. However, America is considering waiving tariffs on certain Japanese auto parts out of the 400 types, according to the list provided by Japan  . Also, Trump has agreed to not impose tariffs on Japanese autos for the time being  . It is worth noting here that the Trump administration was considering invoking Section 232 of the\u00a0 Trade Expansion Act of 1960  , which will enable it to levy tariffs of up to 25% on autos exported to the United States on\u00a0 national security grounds.   Cheers or Thumbs-Down to the Deal?  The final draft of the deal is yet to be prepared and is expected to be signed during or close to the 74th session of the UN General Assembly  , which opens on Sep 17. For any trade deal to be effective, it has to be presented before the parliament in Japan\u00a0 for approval.  Therefore, it is necessary for the leaders to sign the deal in September so that it can be presented before the\u00a0Diet's extraordinary session\u00a0 beginning in October  .  Per source  , Abe has to face criticism  in Tokyo on the deal as it is expected to do little good to the Japanese economy and reduce protection to Japanese farmers, provided United States allows some respite from automobile tariffs  . However, for Trump, this deal is expected to boost his position in the 2020 presidential election campaign as the U.S. farm lobby holds major influence\u00a0 in Washington  .  ETFs to Snap Up    US Agricultural/Livestock ETFs   The agricultural sector in the United States can reap benefits from a trade between Japan and United States. In fact, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue  praised the proposed agreement and stated that they can sell more in Japanese markets  as the move will be \"removing existing barriers for our products.\" Thus, investors can keep an eye on a few ETFs like the\u00a0 Teucrium Wheat Fund WEAT  ,\u00a0 MLCX Grains ETN GRU  , Teucrium Corn Fund CORN  ,\u00a0 iPath Bloomberg Grains Subindex Total Return ETN JJG  and\u00a0 iPath Dow Jones-UBS Livestock Subindex Total Return ETN COW  (see:\u00a0 all the Agricultural ETFs here  ).   S&P 500 Growth ETFs   Investors can also grab a few growth-oriented ETFs replicating the S&P 500 index as improved export levels and enhanced agricultural sector business can drive these funds. For example, Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF VOOG  , SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF SPYG  and iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF IVW  .   US Small-Cap ETFs   Due to their higher domestic exposure and more volatile nature, micro-caps can be poised to gain from the trade deal. Here are a few: iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF IWO  , iShares S&P SmallCap 600 Growth ETF IJT  , SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap Growth ETF SLYG  and Vanguard S&P Small-Cap 600 Growth ETF VIOG  .

        "Fridays leading into holiday weekends, particularly the Friday prior to Labor Day, usually don't generate much excitement on Wall Street and if there is, it's usually a bad sign. So with that in mind, today's results were nothing to be concerned about.",
        "In fact, the results for this Friday, the last trading day of August, weren't too shabby when considering there was a concerning consumer data point released earlier today. Regular readers know that I've been beating the consumer drum quite a bit recently and it is a story worth following for investors.",
        "\"The University of Michigan's final sentiment index fell to 89.8 in August from a previously reported 92.1 and 98.4 in July,\" according to Bloomberg . \"The gauge of current conditions dropped to the lowest since October 2016, while the expectations index matched January as the weakest since that same period.\"",
        "Even with that the Nasdaq Composite finished lower by 0.13% while the S&P 500 eked out a gain of 0.06%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day up 0.16%. In late trading, just over half of the Dow's 30 components were trading higher.",
        "Today's Dow Jones Industrial Average winners were not large in percentage terms, but two of the standouts merit caution and not just because they are defensive names. Plenty Dow stocks with defensive leanings have been solid performers for the bulk of this year, but UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH ) isn't a member of that group.",
        "The healthcare benefits giant gained 1.35% today, good for the best performance among Dow stocks, but the shares still finished August with a loss of more than 1.44%. The best-case scenario is that traders were doing some nibbling at UNH shares today in anticipation of a possible rally over the last four months of the year, but my prescription for caution here stems from a looming democratic debate in September, which could stir more Medicare For All talk. That's always a drag on UNH.",
        "Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA ) jumped 1.57% today, but this is another example of a dog Dow stock with fleas. Despite today's gain, this Dow stock also finished August with a loss of more than 7%.",
        "Two other Dow stocks that were winners today, each closing higher by about 1% that I'd be careful with are Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT ) and Dow (NYSE: DOW ). These are both tariff-sensitive names that notched double-digit declines this month. Maybe trade talks will progress, providing catalysts for these type of cyclical stocks, but in absence of those headlines, investors considering Dow stocks of this nature are likely making no more than technical bets over the near-term.",
        "As I noted above, there were some bounces in defensive Dow stocks today while some similar names saw departures. Namely, McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ) were two of the blue chip index's worst-performing names today, each shedding more than 1%.",
        "Speculation here, but today's action in those stocks may have been nothing more than some profit taking because McDonald's and P&G posted an average August gain of 3.66%. Given September's reputation for being a rough month for stocks, it would not be surprising to see those Dow stocks do a little better next month.",
        "With all the talk about trade tensions and the Federal Reserve's plans for interest rates, investors should not take their eyes off the earnings ball. Unfortunately, the news isn't so hot to this point in the the third quarter.",
        " \"During the first two months of the third quarter, analysts lowered earnings estimates for companies in the S&P 500 for the quarter,\" according to FactSet . \"The Q3 bottom-up EPS estimate (which is an aggregation of the median EPS estimates of all the companies in the index for the third quarter) dropped by 3.0% (to $41.64 from $42.90) during this period.\"",
        "On another note, investors looking for sector-level ideas for September may want to consider financial services and utilities, which on a historical basis, are the best-performing groups in the ninth month of the year.",
        "Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.",

      "title": "Compass Minerals International Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 5.75% Yield (CMP) - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank''  report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is Compass Minerals International Inc (Symbol: CMP), which saw buying by CEO Kevin S. Crutchfield.      Back on August 16, Crutchfield invested $98,920.00 into 2,000 shares of CMP, for a cost per share of $49.46. In trading on Friday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Compass Minerals International Inc (Symbol: CMP) and achieve a cost basis 0.4% cheaper than Crutchfield, with shares changing hands as low as $49.27 per share. It should be noted that Crutchfield has collected $0.72/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently up 1.1% on their purchase from a total return basis. Compass Minerals International Inc shares are currently trading -0.85% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of CMP shares, versus its 200 day moving average:  makeArticleAd();     Looking at the chart above, CMP's low point in its 52 week range is $38.19 per share, with $70.40 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $49.66. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which insider buying was recorded over the last six months:     Purchased Insider Title Shares Price/Share Value   03/28/2019 Richard S. Grant Chairman & Interim CEO 2,000 $52.54 $105,080.00   05/13/2019 James D. Standen Chief Financial Officer 692 $52.05 $36,018.60   05/13/2019 Lori A. Walker Director 700 $52.21 $36,547.00   05/10/2019 Joseph E. Reece Director 1,000 $53.51 $53,510.00   05/09/2019 Valdemar L. Fischer Director 2,000 $52.20 $104,400.00   08/16/2019 Kevin S. Crutchfield President and CEO 2,000 $49.46 $98,920.00      The DividendRank report noted that among the coverage universe, CMP shares displayed both attractive valuation metrics and strong profitability metrics. The report also cited the strong quarterly dividend history at Compass Minerals International Inc, and favorable long-term multi-year growth rates in key fundamental data points.    The report stated, '' Dividend investors approaching investing from a value standpoint are generally most interested in researching the strongest most profitable companies, that also happen to be trading at an attractive valuation. That's what we aim to find using our proprietary DividendRank formula, which ranks the coverage universe based upon our various criteria for both profitability and valuation, to generate a list of the top most 'interesting' stocks, meant for investors as a source of ideas that merit further research.  ''    The annualized dividend paid by Compass Minerals International Inc is $2.88/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 08/29/2019. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for CMP, which the report stressed as being of key importance. Indeed, studying a company's past  dividend history  can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

      "text": [
        " On Friday, Campbell CPB  shares soared over 8% after the company reported strong Q4 results before the opening bell. The company has had a solid year thus far, rising over 42% year-to-date. The consumer staples company has benefited from the recent uncertainty that has plagued investors, sending them pouring into safer dividend yielding stocks. The consumer staples giant closed out their fiscal 2019 on a solid note and is looking to continue its success in the closing half of the year. Let's delve deeper into the company and how our Zacks estimates have them performing in the near future.  Overview and Q4 Performance  The company is based out of Camden, New Jersey, and together with its subsidiaries, is a worldwide manufacturer and marketer of branded convenience food products. The company's brands are sold in approximately 120 countries. Some of their most recognized brands include Campbell's, Prego, Pepperidge Farm, V8, Swanson, and Pace. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the company finalized the deal to sell off their Bolthouse Farms business as well as their Garden Fresh Gourmet business. After the transaction, Campbell now reports under the Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks segments. The company acquired Snyder's-Lance last year, which has boosted its Global Biscuits and Snacks unit sales. The company has been benefiting from its board-led strategy of undergoing robust cost saving initiatives such as increasing their focus on their Snacks segment and divesting underperforming units. In Q4, Campbell reported earnings of $0.42 per share, beating our estimates by 2.44%. Revenues came in at $1.78 billion, missing our estimate by 11%. The company's top line popped 2% and earnings were a whopping 96% surge from the year ago quarter. Campbell's Meals and Beverages segment reeled in $813 million and its organic sales increased 1%. The hike in organic sales reflected strong performances form the company's US soups, Prego sauces, and Pace Mexican sauces. The Snacks segment rose 3% Y/Y to $967 million and their organic sales rose 4%. Their strong organic sales reflected the continued growth in Pepperidge Farm bakery products, Goldfish crackers and a few other products.  What Lies Ahead?  Our consensus estimates call for earnings to rise 1.27% next quarter and for the company to bring in $2.47 billion, a 8.35% drop from the prior year's quarter. The Meals and Beverages segment is expected to slip roughly 1% to $1.23 billion and Global Biscuits and Snacks is forecasted to total $1.22 billion in Q1 2020. The company has introduced new soup recipes with added chicken and tomatoes and eliminated preservatives in order to appeal to the new health-conscious consumer landscape. The company's initiatives to cut costs and focus on the aspects of their business that perform well have boded well for the company thus far. Selling certain segments of their business that were weighing down their bottom line helped catapult Campbell's earnings in Q4. Campbell is looking to turn things around, and if it continues to adhere its products to the conventional consumer and continues focusing on strengthening their snacks segment, then the company's YTD run will likely increase.

        "      Twitter    CEO   Jack   Dorsey    's   Twitter    account was hacked Friday afternoon, with the infiltrators   tweeting numerous racial slurs as well as a bomb threat. Tweets   from the hackers began shortly before 1 p.m. Friday and were   removed after about 20 minutes. The hackers also retweeted a number of other offensive   messages, including one stating that \"Nazi Germany did nothing   wrong.\"   makeArticleAd(); A Twitter spokesperson confirmed the incident on Twitter,   promising that the company was investigating the   circumstances:   Yes, Jack's account was compromised. We're working on it       and investigating what happened. - Brandon Borrman (@bborrman)       August 30, 2019      The company later said that it had secured Dorsey's account,   and that it had no indications for a breach of Twitter's   systems.   The account is now secure, and there is no indication that       Twitter's systems have been compromised. - Twitter Comms (@TwitterComms)       August 30, 2019      The tweets in question were apparently sent with the use of   Cloudhopper, a mobile messaging app that the company acquired   back in 2010. Cloudhopper's technology is now powering Twitter's   SMS functionality, and among other things allows users to tweet   via SMS. This suggests that the hackers were able to hijack or   spoof the phone number linked to Dorsey's Twitter account, and   then simply tweet via SMS. This could be both good and bad news for Twitter. The good   news is that the hackers likely didn't break into Twitter's   servers. Instead, they could, for instance, have called Dorsey's   phone company and pretended to be him in order to take over his   number. The bad news is that Twitter doesn't seem to have the   necessary safeguards for SMS posting. This isn't the first time prominent Twitter accounts have been   taken over by hackers. Past victims of similar hacks   include Netflix    ,   HBO    and Marvel. But while some of those hacks in the past were merely   trying to highlight security vulnerabilities, the hackers in this   case chose to spread racist messages. The combination of a security incident with racist slurs   represents a bit of a double whammy for Twitter. The company has   long struggled to respond to the presence of extremists on its   platform, with users routinely complaining that it doesn't do   enough to ban racists. The company has been trying to answer its critics by imposing   stricter content guidelines while also investing in what it calls   healthy conversations - but obviously, not all of its users seem   to be on board with that direction.

      "title": "Brookfield Property REIT (BPR) Passes Through 7% Yield Mark - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel  , in trading on Friday, shares of Brookfield Property REIT Inc (Symbol: BPR) were yielding above the 7% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.32), with the stock changing hands as low as $18.76 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the iShares Russell 3000 ETF ( IWV  ) back on 5/31/2000 - you would have paid $78.27 per share. Fast forward to 5/31/2012 and each share was worth $77.79 on that date, a loss of $0.48 or 0.6% decrease over twelve years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $10.77 per share in dividends over the same period, increasing your return to 13.15%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.0%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 7% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Brookfield Property REIT Inc (Symbol: BPR) is a member of the Russell 3000, giving it special status as one of the largest 3000 companies on the U.S. stock markets.      In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Brookfield Property REIT Inc, looking at the history chart for BPR below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 7% annual yield.   makeArticleAd();   Click here to find out which 9 other dividend   stocks just recently went on sale \u00bb  ",

      "text": [
        "There's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy. Back on May 31, United States Steel Corp.'s Director, John V. Faraci, invested $14,376.00 into 1,000 shares of X, for a cost per share of $14.38. Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money. In trading on Friday, bargain hunters could buy shares of United States Steel Corp. (Symbol: X) and achieve a cost basis 24.3% cheaper than Faraci, with shares changing hands as low as $10.88 per share. It should be noted that Faraci has collected $0.05/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently down 24.0% on their purchase from a total return basis. United States Steel Corp. shares are currently trading down about 0.6% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of X shares, versus its 200 day moving average:       Looking at the chart above, X's low point in its 52 week range is $10.16 per share, with $30.91 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $11.02.

        "The ratings action follows the government's announcement to \"re-profile\" some $100 billion in debt earlier in the week, sinking Argentine bonds and igniting worries of a full-blown debt crisis for Latin America's third-largest economy. ",

      "title": "Can Apple's New Card Succeed Despite Low Mobile Payments in the US? - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        " Apple AAPL  announced earlier this year that they would be offering a credit card in partnership with Goldman Sachs GS  . Users are able to sign up for the credit card through their phones and access the card in just minutes. Apple issues their card holders a sleek titanium card for instances when an institution doesn't accept Apple Pay. The new card is a step into uncharted territory for both companies. Apple is trying to develop a new revenue stream beyond its hardware products, and Goldman Sachs is continuing its push into consumer financial products with the Apple card. However, skeptics point to how mobile payments has not caught on in the US like it has in other countries. Let's take a closer look into the card and the obstacles it will have to overcome to succeed.  Putting the Pressure on Wireless Carriers  The tech giant's move into banking could enable it to provide customers with financing on new iPhone models. If Apple were to reach this point, it would break off its relationships with wireless carriers like Verizon VZ  and AT&T T  . Wireless carriers sell expensive new phones to consumers in installment plans that are added to their monthly bill. The customers are then locked into the carrier until the phone is paid off. The Apple card paired with the SIM technology can make it easier for customers to switch between wireless carriers. On top of all that, the card pays 2% cash back on Apple Pay transactions, 3% on direct Apple purchases, and 1% on purchases made with the physical card. Apple emphasizes privacy and security on the card; Apple does not know what you bought, how much you paid, or where you bought it. The analytics for spending are done on the device, not in Apple servers. Furthermore, Goldman will not sell purchase data to third parties. Apple Pay is accepted by more than 70% of US retailers and is projected to work in more than 40 countries by the end of 2019. Additionally, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that \"Apple Pay will work in the mass transit systems of Portland, Chicago, and New York later this year.\"  Mobile Payments Have Struggled in US  Despite increasing smartphone dependence, most Americans are still not using their smartphones to pay for things. This isn't the case for countries like India and China where they are experiencing a massive increase in mobile purchases. In China, smartphone payments made up more than 80% of all purchases in the country in 2018. The US had adoption rates of mobile payment apps of less than 10%. Experts see the lack of interest in mobile payments and other rewards cards as major headwinds for the Apple credit card. The lack of mobile payments is an anomaly, as over 81% of Americans own a smartphone. A major reason phones became the go to payment option in China and India is because cash was the only other, far less attractive, option. Both countries were cash dependent economies and mobile payments provided people with a much more convenient method of payment. India's government encouraged digital financial transactions in order to stimulate tax revenue, as cash payments often happen under the table. In China, tech giants like Alibaba BABA  and Tencent TCEHY  began battling for consumers' wallets and eclipsed banks during the skirmish. The US is a different ballgame for mobile payments, as the credit and debit card system is well established and widely used. Conventional paying methods have still dominated the landscape, with credit cards making up more than 80% of purchases in 2018; Apple Pay made up only 9%. PayPal (PYPL) was the most popular non-bank option at 40% adoption.  Bottom Line  Apple's newest services initiative is an innovative method of expanding its revenue streams. The product definitely has some appeal with the cash back it offers for Apple payments, and the convenience of having your card within your phone at all times. However, the lack of mobile purchases in the US and the saturated market for credit cards are both headwinds for the Apple credit card. If Apple can successfully commercialize the credit card, then it opens many doors for the tech giant, but it first must figure out a way to conventionalize mobile purchases in the US.

      "text": [
        "By Svea Herbst-Bayliss",
        "BOSTON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Jana Partners on Friday disclosed a large new stake in Outback Steakhouse owner Bloomin' Brands Inc  , returning for the second time in nearly two years to push for fresh changes after reaching a settlement in 2018.",
        "Jana, one of the industry's most powerful activist hedge funds, said in a regulatory filing that it owns 9%, or 7.8 million shares, and plans to discuss strategic alternatives with management. These might include a sale of the company, spinning off pieces of the company, changing the way it spends money and who sits on its board.",
        "Bloomin' Brands did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
        "Bloomin' Brands stock price jumped 6.3% to trade at $17.82, erasing all of this year's losses, after Jana made its filing. When Jana disclosed its first meaningful stake in the company, in November 2017, the stock price surged 12% to trade at $20.54.",
        "The company and the activist hedge fund quickly reached a settlement in February 2018 and agreed to add an independent director to its eight member board. Wendy Beck, a former chief financial officer at Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, still sits on the board.",
        "Jana, which prefers to stay out of the limelight, quietly took profits on its position as management declared the company had turned a corner. By the end of the second quarter 2018, Jana no longer listed the stock as a position on its regulatory filing.",
        "But an increase in stock sales by company insiders coupled with a sinking stock price prompted Jana to return a second time, something it generally does not do, a person familiar with the fund's investments said.",
        "Jana Partners, run by Barry Rosenstein, has scored big wins including pushing for changes at Whole Food Market that  prompted the grocer to sell itself to Amazon.com .",
        "Bloomin' Brands faced two activists two years ago. Barington Capital called for a spinoff of three smaller restaurant chains -- Bonefish Grill, Carrabba's and Fleming's -- to be separated into a new company and for Outback to be run independently. It also asked for changes on the board and said costs were too high.",
        "Earlier this year, as Jana Partners was building its Bloomin' Brands stake anew, Barington cut its position by more than 75%, a filing shows."

      "text": [
        "A company's own top management tend to have the best inside view into the business, so when company officers make major buys, investors are wise to take notice. Presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So in this series we look at the largest insider buys by the ''top brass'' over the trailing six month period, one of which was a total of $400.9K invested across 3 purchases by Keith Koci, EVP, Chief Financial Officer at Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (Symbol: CLF).   Purchased Insider Title Shares Price/Share Value   05/22/2019 Keith Koci EVP, Chief Financial Officer 5,000 $9.65 $48,250.00   08/07/2019 Keith Koci EVP, Chief Financial Officer 30,000 $8.39 $251,682.00   08/22/2019 Keith Koci EVP, Chief Financial Officer 12,500 $8.08 $100,998.75      Koci's average cost works out to $8.44/share.

        " On Aug 30, we issued an updated research report on Colfax Corporation CFX  . In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 6.2%, compared with industry  's rise of 0.7%.     Existing Scenario  makeArticleAd();  Colfax is likely to benefit from its focus on strengthening segmental businesses and productivity actions, product developments as well as expansion in emerging markets. Also, the company follows a sound capital-allocation strategy. Its focus on investing in innovation, business expansion in attractive markets, and growing the digital base is likely to prove conducive to its growth. Also, the company intends to become more competent on the back of meaningful business acquisitions. In this regard, it has completed the buyout of DJO Global in February 2019. This acquisition was in sync with Colfax's efforts to diversify the business structure and enable its entry into the orthopaedic solutions industry. Notably, acquisitions added 63% to Colfax's sales growth in the second quarter of 2019. The company predicts that DJO Global and other buyouts will continue to be beneficial in the quarters ahead. However, escalating costs have been a major cause of concern for the company over the past few quarters. For instance, Colfax's cost of sales jumped 33.2% in the first six months of 2019 while the same rose 44.3% in the second quarter. The company predicts corporate expenses to be approximately $60-$65 million in 2019. We believe that rising costs and expenses, if unchecked, will be detrimental to the company's margin. In addition, analysts have also become increasingly bearish on Colfax. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings has declined from $2.26 to $1.96 on account of six downward estimate revisions against two upward.

        " In less than three weeks, the U.S. Federal Reserve will hold   its next regularly scheduled meeting. That's when the direction   of the country's monetary policy will be decided. As usual, the   Fed's action will be watched not only for cues about the   direction of interest rates but also in terms of their reading of   the economy. After all, no one has more data at their disposal   than the Fed. First things first. Come September 17 and 18, investors will   be expecting yet another interest rate cut. This won't be coming   out of the blue: Policymakers have been indicating as much in   recent days. After all, interest-rate policies are focused on the   economy, which is slowing all over the world. The markets now   expect a quarter-point cut at the September meeting. As you well know, at the conclusion of the July 30-31 meeting,   the Fed made the first rate cut in more than a decade. After the   widely expected quarter-point cut, the benchmark rate now sits in   a range between 2% and 2.25%. That action, however, failed to   prop the U.S. stock market: The S&P 500 index declined about   2.9% in August, thanks to the newly emerged trade-related   uncertainties. Over the past month, investors have taken a decisively   defensive stance. This means that so-called \"value\" investments   are coming into sharper focus.  Things Are Getting Tricky For Growth Investors     A rallying stock market and a strong economy are typically led by   the so-called \"growth\" investments. These are the industries and   companies that can -- and do -- grow profits faster than the   economy. Growth stocks are mainly associated these days with tech   companies -- particularly in subsectors like the cloud where big   things are happening and where money is flowing at a fast clip.   Companies in these areas can be reasonably expected to post   annual profit growth rates well in excess of 20% in the   foreseeable future. They can stumble, of course. But so far, many   of them haven't. In the past month, however, some have given up   some ground, thanks to profit-taking and to the market getting   more defensive. Many recent IPOs such as Tufin Software Technologies (Nasdaq:      TUFN    ) (which I wrote about   here    ), an innovative network software company, or Allogene (Nasdaq:      ALLO    ), a clinical-stage cancer research biotech -- are also growth   companies. Both have the potential to grow exponentially if their   technologies take off. But they are riskier than the more   established tech or cloud companies I discussed above because   they still burn cash -- and therefore they can suffer more when   the markets panic.  The Market Shifts Focus     On the other hand, bargain-priced stocks -- the ones that are   called \"value\" in market-speak - have become more attractive to   investors as growth prospects deteriorate amid trade war   reacceleration. Investors have also become more price-sensitive   this summer, based on several metrics, from earnings per share to   dividends per share. Here's what performed well: defensive sectors such as consumer   staples (up 0.7%), utilities (up 3.6%) and real estate (up   5.1%). And here's what sold off: energy (down 9.3%), financials (down   7.9%), materials (down 5.9%), industrials (down 5.5%), and   technology (down 5.3%). These underperforming sectors are   leveraged to the economy.  Action To Take     This market action indicates that investors are worried. However,   there is light at the end of the tunnel for growth investors. We can reasonably expect that cheaper money (when interest   rates are low, money is more accessible and credit is cheap) will   create more incentives for growth stocks. That's because cheap   money typically leads to asset inflation -- which, in the long   run, is what bull markets are made of. In other words, the ideal   environment for growth stocks is a low-interest-rate environment.   Cheap money is good for growth. At the same time, as the recent market action has indicated,   the time has come to exercise caution. My advice: look to make   your portfolio better suited for this risker environment while   staying invested and positioned for further gains. If that means   looking to make some portfolio adjustments -- taking a couple of   gains and a few losses, then so be it.

      "title": "Peloton Warns of Poor Financial Reporting Controls - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "Maker of high-end home fitness gear Peloton dropped its S-1 Registration Statement earlier\u00a0this week. There are plenty of yellow and red flags in the filing, such as insiders wielding supervoting Class B shares that are entitled to 20 votes per share, or the fact that CEO John Foley's wife, Jill Foley, serves as vice president of Boutique (Peloton also has an apparel\u00a0business that represents less than 2% of revenue) and gets paid an annual salary of nearly $200,000.",
        "However, the most stunning red flag is an admission that Peloton's financial reporting controls aren't quite up to snuff.",
        "Image source: Peloton.",
        "\"In the course of preparing our financial statements for fiscal 2018, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting,\" Peloton states. \"The material weakness had not been remediated as of June 30, 2019.\"",
        "This isn't the first time a company preparing to go public has issued such a warning, but it doesn't provide investors with a lot of confidence in the numbers they're perusing. For instance, enterprise software maker BlackLine similarly said\u00a0it had \"identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting\" in 2015 ahead of its 2016 IPO. There are\u00a0other\u00a0examples.",
        "For Peloton -- which is very much a growth stock , with revenue more than doubling to $915 million last fiscal year -- its material weaknesses relate to \"information technology general controls, controls to address segregation of certain accounting duties, timely reconciliation and analysis of certain key accounts and the review of journal entries.\" The company concedes that it simply did not have the appropriate business processes and personnel, in part because it has been a private company up until now and reporting requirements for public companies are far more stringent.",
        "The company plans to hire the necessary talent to fix the problem:",
        "To address our material weaknesses, we have added personnel as well as implemented new financial systems and processes. We intend to continue to take steps to remediate the material weaknesses described above through hiring additional qualified accounting and financial reporting personnel, and further evolving our accounting processes. We will not be able to fully remediate these material weaknesses until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time.",
        "Peloton's independent accounting firm isn't required to sign off on the company's internal controls until it is no longer considered an \"emerging growth company\" under the JOBS Act. That could happen fairly soon, as one of the thresholds\u00a0for that definition is $1.07 billion in annual gross revenue. If Peloton surpasses that level, it will no longer be classified as an \"emerging growth company.\" At that point, the accounting firm \"may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating.\"",
        "The company concludes, \"Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock.\"",
        "10 stocks we like better than\u00a0Walmart\r\n When investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they\u00a0have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has\u00a0quadrupled the market.*",

        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Hello and welcome to our third quarter conference call. We're pleased to report overall investment performance sustained recent momentum despite some market volatility during the quarter. Sales improved again as a result with encouraging trends in both the wirehouse and institutional channels. We remain very focused on managing our expenses, while simultaneously making the necessary investments in the business to deliver strong performance. This month, we announced several senior level additions and organizational changes to certain investment teams designed to enhance our portfolio management, research and data analytics capabilities.",
        "With me today is our President and Chief Operating Officer, Jeni Johnson and joining us for his first earnings call is Matthew Nicholls, our CFO. Matthew has been with us for three months now and he is already very immersed in our business. We're glad to have them with us.",
        "I'd now like to open the line up for your questions. Thank you.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Your line is now live.",
        "Glenn Schorr -- Evercore -- Analyst",
        "Thanks very much. This might be a little complex, but sales were basically 50:50 split between inside and outside the US. While the AUM is more like two-thirds, one-third. I'm just curious, if you could talk about what's driving the more balanced mix in sales and what the fee rate implications going forward? And maybe you could do that assuming a kind of a flat flow environment.",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah. I mean, I would first -- I think the -- there was a lot of institutional movement kind of moving around. So I'm not sure I would draw a conclusion that, that number or percentage of sales is here to stay. We'd have to kind of take a look at that. And I think the -- from just a general statement, some of the pressures that you're seeing in the US and certainly from a retail side and the move to passive and things on the retail channel, you're not really seeing that as much globally. So I think that you don't have that pressure like you do so. I would think that some of those numbers should increase. And probably just overall the global side relies more on global bond sales and that continues to do pretty well, especially over the last few quarters in the retail channel outside of the US.",
        "Jennifer M. Johnson -- President and Chief Operating Officer",
        "And I'd just add, we have had some success selling some fixed maturity plans, both in Asia and in Europe.",
        "Glenn Schorr -- Evercore -- Analyst",
        "Okay. And that's in the one, but not yet funded pipeline, I take it?",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "No, that one funded during the quarter, I think the total was --",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "$500 million",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "That was a $500 million one during the quarter that funded.",
        "Glenn Schorr -- Evercore -- Analyst",
        "Got it. And then maybe just one on benefits -- benefits. So just talk about how performance is going? And then more broadly, what you're doing to leverage both their capabilities and to distribute more of their products across your broader platform?",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah. I mean, I think we're very pleased with how it's going. As you know, it's a different kind of sales cycle than more like private equity. In building it into the retail channel, we're making great progress. But to get -- those are going to be new products, whether they're interval funds for the US retail market, we're working with wealth management platforms to leverage the BDC, as well as the a public REIT and having success there. So we're optimistic about that. And I think in the last five months, we had over 375 meetings globally and feel like we're getting very strong reception in both the institutional and retail channel.",
        "Nothing to report, I mean, as far as the very stable business right now in terms of AUM and profitability. And we're still very optimistic looking at the pipeline going forward on growth. And I'll ask Matthew or Jenny wants to add anything on BSP [0:17:33] .",
        "Jennifer M. Johnson -- President and Chief Operating Officer",
        "We funded $125 million CLO in the quarter and I just -- I would say, just to add to Greg's comments on the interest globally both on the institutional and the retail side, there is a strong interest. And it does take a little bit longer on a sale, but we've been very pleased with the response in the market.",
        "Glenn Schorr -- Evercore -- Analyst",
        "Okay. Thank you.",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "And the first -- I think the first -- the next large fund is targeted to close in the second half of 2019, senior opportunities fund.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. Your next question is coming from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.",
        "Craig Siegenthaler -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst",
        "Thanks. Good morning everyone. Of the $5 billion in discretionary cash and investments, what level of this would you feel comfortable deploying into an acquisition before considering any debt raise?",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "Good morning. I think we answer to that is that, we are flexible in terms of how much cash we will use for an acquisition, but I would caution everybody to make the point that we're going to remain conserved in terms of our balance sheet. The structure and consideration of any transaction were always result in a conservative performer outcome, which means that the provision of us using all of that cash for a single transaction or a series of transactions is quite low. And for any larger transaction, we're most likely to use a combination of cash and stock.",
        "Craig Siegenthaler -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst",
        "Thanks, Matt. And just as a follow-up on M&A here. I saw the commentary on wealth managers, so I'm thinking what type of D2C businesses are you targeting for a potential acquisition?",
        "Jennifer M. Johnson -- President and Chief Operating Officer",
        "Well, so, one is, we think we have obviously Fiduciary Trust and we think that that's a great business and benefits from scale. So we'd be looking for strategic acquisitions in markets where we don't have a big presence. So that would be one. We think there is some interesting kind of FinTech type of acquisitions that can enhance the high net worth business. And when you're dealing with high net worth you have multi-generations, so the younger generation is often more interested in more self-servicing technology and so buying some start-ups that have that capability is interesting to us.",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "And Fiduciary Trust is a great business and we have a good foundation to build upon. I think you all know that the activity around wealth management across private equity investing in particular is very significant and the amount of different integration and roll-out transactions into wealth managers is very pronounced in the marketplace. And frankly, that activity has been concentrated in private equity and there wasn't any reason why strategics that all wealth managers could not be more active in that transaction close.",
        "Craig Siegenthaler -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst",
        "Thank you.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ken Worthington from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live.",
        "Kenneth Worthington -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst",
        "Hi. Good morning. Maybe first on the global equity business, it's been about 4.5 years since your last quarterly inflows into that asset class. Since then, you've seen about $100 billion redemption on a business that's just $170 billion in size. So, if you can solve the problem here, it would seem as though there is a lot of upside. Maybe where do you see the biggest issues in the global equity franchise today sort of leading to or contributing to those outflows? And then as you think about the next two to three years, maybe what are the steps you're considering that could stop or slow the asset losses. And with Matthew joining the team, might there be something more strategic on the M&A side that might help turn the tide here.",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah. No, I think you're absolutely right. And even if you look at this quarter and just say, all right, look at the overall flows, and that -- without that category you'd probably be in positive flows. So for us it's really the deep value style of a Templeton, of a mutual series that we've all talked about it just about on every call. But we have another quarter where you have 200 to 300 basis points in differential and performance between your MSCI value and growth indices, and that trend has continued. So Templeton has stuck to its knitting and is a deep core value manager, and until that reverses it's just -- it's very difficult to get a lot of attention back.",
        "And then you have the pressure in the retail channels, which is the active and passive. I think the more successful managers through this cycle have had the flexibility of core mandates. That's what our solutions group allows us to do is to build that. We have a very successful global growth manager. It's one of our fastest growing funds, but it's $1.3 billion today and with inflows, and just getting on platforms with long-term -- with its record getting past five-10 years now. So that doesn't make up when you have a franchise as powerful as Templeton on the other side, but any deep value manager it's been very difficult. So I think that that needs to change.",
        "We continue to make changes within that organization, and Jenny will speak to some of that in a minute. But for us, it's really, when you say the future, and how do you -- I think the flexibility of an active manager is important and not to be bound by a strict discipline or at to have an offering out there and we can do that. We have all of those capabilities of very successful global growth managing and very successful value. And we have the solutions capability to build core assets and that's what we are doing with some of the sleeves within our SMA accounts and things.",
        "But Jenny can speak to maybe just specifically with Templeton some of the changes that we...",
        "Jennifer M. Johnson -- President and Chief Operating Officer",
        "Yes, so we acquired Edinburgh Partners and brought back Dr. Sandy Nairn who, as you may recall, was John Templeton's Director of Research. And he has been working and he is the chairman over the global equity group. And he has been working with the team there very closely. And we just announced two big hires there; Alan Bartlett coming in when Norm Boersma retires at the end of the year as the CIO. Alan is probably a little bit better known in Europe. But Sandy and Alan have had a long relationship and very excited to bring him in. And then key hires Peter Sartori in Asia.",
        "And this is one of those things were when value underperforms and we've obviously been through this cycle a few times. But you look at it and while there is outflow, the reality is, take the Templeton growth fund, it's got average PE of about 13.5 versus say the SMP at 21. People who are building a full portfolio want to make sure that they hedge the risk. And so, we still think that this is a great franchise. And when things shifts back to value, people would be rewarded with this. But in the meantime, we continue to invest in a business and give great focus and make sure we have good talent there.",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "And I would also add just when you look at Templeton, we did make some changes with the emerging markets group and successions with Mark Mobius. And that team and more flexibility in I would say in style where the IT has become a bigger portion of the emerging markets indices. And we felt we need flexibility there.",
        "We have managed through that change. And the performance is excellent for that group. And also the quality as far process and that we think it's a real opportunity on the institutional side for the first time with many changes in that group. So, I think that it's -- we are examining it, but I think with Templeton's large institutional base, it's very hard just to suddenly say it's going to be more flexible in how we become more growth year [0:26:06], but I think the flexibility to figure out -- new ways to figure out how to be more efficient in the value space is something we are very committed to.",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "And I think, Ken, with respect to your question on M&A, not withstanding all the great internal organic growth we have going as referenced by Jenny and Greg, we have a very proactive approach, I would say, to M&A in both asset management and wealth management. We are specifically not shy of larger scale transactions to create growth and promote diversification of our business. But frankly, only a small handful of those really make much sense.",
        "Amongst other things, we are very focused on certain international locations where we are subscale and we then we can growth. It make sense because of the demographics of those countries. We think expanding and globalizing, I would turn to asset business and build upon acquisition of Benefit Street makes tremendous sense. We believe accelerating scale in certain investment objectives make sense. Institutionally is very important to us. A big focus on strategic activity. And then as we mentioned a second ago, expanding our wealth business on the fiduciary trust.",
        "Kenneth Worthington -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst",
        "Okay. Thank you. And maybe just following up on insurance. You had outflows in the quarter in the DA business, any -- does this foreshadow anything over the next 12 months? I remember last time we had outflows for a number of quarters. And then just to play good cop as well, you highlighted the opportunity on the asset allocation side for the insurance channel. Could you flesh out your comments there a little bit more?",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah. I mean, I think any of the traditional assets that are still in the mutual fund you put under a watch list. I don't there is anything from a significant flow standpoint occurring next quarter. But, all of those assets continue to be under pressure and whether it's transitioning to passive or lower volatility or asset allocation models, we continue to do that. I think we have had plenty of interest on these new models and new allocation within insurance companies, and we continue to see that growth. There is nothing to report as far as new wins this quarter, but hopefully, as we have said before that we can replace a lot of those older mandates and be competitive in the new low-vol and asset allocation area. And that's why we build teams to do.",
        "And I would just say generally, that from a pipeline and flow and this is always a hard one for us to kind of forecast for you as what we think next quarter. I think we've seen some significant wins. But we also know that we have a few big mandates and they're all in the very lower fee ones, moving out one -- a couple of big ones in Canada that were Canadian equity and Canadian fix specifically, but relatively low fee, but we had a big win in the K2 side.",
        "So we kind of look at and say that we have $4 billion in and $4 billion out between just those wins and losses. And some of that will come out next quarter -- some of it will come in next quarter. But it's kind of as best we can look at the pipeline at somewhat of a wash right now. And I think, we can't give much color beyond that, because we don't know specifically when the funding dates are for some of those mandates.",
        "Kenneth Worthington -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst",
        "Okay. Great. Thank you very much.",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Thanks.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live.",
        "Patrick Davitt -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst",
        "Hey. Good morning, guys. I guess, Matt, I'll with you. I know that you've been in the position for three months, so you may be frame a bit more what you see as the key priorities and opportunities over the next year or two for you. And within that theme, any potential changes and how you think about parameters around looking at the evaluation of potential M&A targets?",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "So my priorities have been to get up to speed as quickly as possible on the finance group. First of all, that's a big group here doing lots of different things across 35 countries. So the first thing I've done is that. Second thing is to form a more centralized corporate development function and focus more on corporate strategy on the centralized level across all the different groups that we have in the firm, so we've been working on that. Third is to really select where we want to focus our time on strategy. There's lots of things we can do across wealth and asset management, and in different geographies, different asset classes, as I've referenced.",
        "So focusing on a few of those where we think it's going to make the biggest difference to our firm, expeditiously without panic is been very important to me and what I've been focused on with both the management team and the executive committee here. So that's been my primary focus.",
        "And then, obviously, a focus on the capital structure making sure we retain the financial flexibility that we have today that we talk a fair amount in our prepared remarks about. And that's not going to change, as I referenced in the beginning. But our ability or willingness, if you will, to deploy some of that cash is certainly the top of our mind strategically. So that will be my main priorities to begin with.",
        "Patrick Davitt -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst",
        "Okay. Thanks. And then, the expense guidance, including BSP year-over-year and 2019, is that on the fall of 2018 number including all one timers. And through that lens, any updated thoughts on moving to non-GAAP reporting and when you could make that kind of change? And what you think the size of the potential adjustments could be if you do make that change?",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "Yeah. So fiscal 2019, including BSP and non-recurring items net of S&D is about plus 11% to 12% from fiscal 2018 and no adjustments to 2018 on that. So that's correct. What's your second question?",
        "Patrick Davitt -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst",
        "Thoughts about moving to a non-GAAP reporting where a lot of these one-timers would be adjusted out of your reported earnings number. And to the extent you do make such an adjustment? What you think the scale of the change would be to a 2020 type number?",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "Yeah. I think at the moment, the way we see it is, the GAAP reporting is the cleanest way to report our financials. We do obviously have adjustments that we try and highlight in our prepared remarks. But until we take one step further in complexity, we intend to keep it as it is and just make sure we have as helpful prepared remarks as possible. And we have our Chief Accounting Officer, Gwen with us also at the table who is staring at me from the [Indecipherable]. So yes, we are sticky with GAAP finance. So we do something more complex.",
        "Patrick Davitt -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst",
        "Fair enough. Thank you.",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "Thank you.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is now live.",
        "Dan Fannon -- Jefferies -- Analyst",
        "Thanks. I guess just to follow-up on that question on -- just to clarify here for the fiscal 2020 expenses, inclusive of BSP that's on a fully loaded '19 number or it's going to be flat?",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Correct, yes.",
        "Dan Fannon -- Jefferies -- Analyst",
        "Okay. And then just a follow-up on kind of the commentary at the beginning and in the prepared remarks around kind of some of the changes you've made, obviously, you talked a bit about the global equity where there also changes on the fixed income side. So curious if you anticipate any changes or I should see any push back from consultants and intermediaries around some of these changes or just kind of flush out a little more detail kind of what you guys have done? So, because I'm sure you know internally it's probably much bigger deal, but externally it's a little hard to see what you guys actually are doing in terms of some of these changes.",
        "Jennifer M. Johnson -- President and Chief Operating Officer",
        "I mean, in -- I'd say one thing, as a firm that has long tenured investment people, people do come to the end of their career and choose to retire and I think none of these have been a surprise around that. Having said that, bringing in Sandy Naren on the Templeton Global Equity Group and having Sonal Desai as a new CIO, they're going to put their own stamp on the investment process. And so the feedback, it always takes a while and people puts you on kind of a wait and see as the process the changes.",
        "We had good feedback and that we were very proactive in reaching out I think over 200 institutional clients on the Templeton team to explain the changes. On the fixed income, creating this quantitative Insights Group, actually we've had it somewhat internally, but what Dr. Sonal decided when she came in is, recognizing that there was opportunity to leverage the Group more broadly across the very fixed income teams. In addition to that, while we had acquired Random Forest we're incorporating data science in some of our fixed-income groups, there is obviously opportunity to continue to do that. And so, by having Roger Bayston just focused on data science and really kind of new Fintech investment opportunities as well as the quantitative strategies, it really highlights and make sure that as a firm, we have the focus on that.",
        "So we really view it as strong evolution in the investment process, I don't think anybody could sit out there and think that they're going to not evolve with the way information is now available in technology and data evolve their investment process to incorporate this. So we really see it as a natural evolution, but in a time where things are evolving quickly. So far it's been well received, but it always takes a little time for these things to settle.",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "And I think it's -- your question reminds me that [0:36:21] mall for progress it's change, I don't like. And I think we recognize that these are some -- take it in a very positive way, some are a little more cautious. And at the end of the day it could cost you short term, some business, but we think it's the right -- these are the right moves to put us on the strongest footing going forward. And that's I think the way we have to look at the business.",
        "Dan Fannon -- Jefferies -- Analyst",
        "Great. Thank you.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Katz from Citi. Your line is now live.",
        "Bill Katz -- Citi -- Analyst",
        "Okay, thank you very much for taking the questions. Most of my questions have been asked already. Just staying on flows for a moment. I appreciate the ins and outs on the institutional side. Just sort of wondering if you could speak to what you've seen in the month for retail, maybe by asset class or by geography.",
        "Jennifer M. Johnson -- President and Chief Operating Officer",
        "So on the retail side, on that from an asset class, I mean, the areas that we're seeing positive flows are tax free, fixed income, the global and international fixed income. The positive on sort of the Franklin equity side, we've made some big investments in personnel on the US retail side to have a focus on, we talked about the New York Stock Exchange channel and in last quarter I think we had a 26% uptick in sales there and we're continuing to see progress there. We're seeing progress and traction on the SMA business. We've had some good wins on the collective investment trusts in the -- with our partnership with Wilmington Trust. So areas that we have focused on with some hires and new personnel, we're seeing some really good traction. It's still early in that process, but we're seeing good traction there. And then of course our Dynetek fund, which I think is in the top decile one, three, five and 10 year is having -- it had its greatest quarter yet as far as net flows.",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Was that the question, Bill? I mean, were you talking about this closed July or I couldn't quite...",
        "Bill Katz -- Citi -- Analyst",
        "I appreciate the strategic answer, but I was hoping to gather more of a tactical update about how July was looking maybe on a net basis?",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah. I mean I don't -- I think it's the market that's been relatively stable through that, so the trends that you're seeing are continuing with uncertainty on the retail side with tax [0:39:01] I think is the one that's emerging and has gone from $2 billion in outflows, a few quarters ago to close to a $1 billion in inflows this quarter. So that's a pretty big reversal and then US equities continue to be strong, as well as multi-asset balance. But nothing and I wouldn't call out anything. I think global bonds has had a little bit of a short term underperformance, so that may affect things in the short run as a perception of rates and the Fed cutting rates versus our position generally, which has been more position for a rising rate environment. But with that said, I think that fund has done very well with its other big bets, so it's not a big drag on the fund. But nothing I think I wouldn't really call it any big changes in terms of just the retail fund flows.",
        "Bill Katz -- Citi -- Analyst",
        "Okay. That's helpful and thanks for the combined answer. And then, just as a follow-up, let's come back to fiscal 2020 expenses for a moment. I guess as I look at the last couple of conference calls and sort of reread some of the transcript and the dialog about the Q&A. It does seem to be a little bit of a difference of how you sort of think about fiscal 2020 today versus maybe where we were three months ago. So is it really now a sort of a flat to slightly lower as you had tried to ring fence that. And within that the annualized savings that you highlighted in your prepared remarks earlier. Is that -- what's the timeline to sort of getting to those savings?",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "Hey. Hi. Bill, it's Matthew. I think a couple of things there. First of all, our guidance has changed a little bit in the sense of bringing it down a fraction. I don't want to overstate that it really is a fraction. So I think beforehand we were talking about it being marginally higher, now we're marginally lower. So that's the first point. That includes by the way and this triangulates back to some of the questions on capital management, it does include some meaningful investments that we continue to make organically around multi-asset business, data science, technology and so on that Jenny referred to. So while we are very disciplined around our expenses, we're also making sure that doesn't compromise the growth strategy that we have internally around our capital. So that's the 2020 answer. Did you have another question on 2020?",
        "Bill Katz -- Citi -- Analyst",
        "No, that's helpful and having met all the tax guides you gave for the fourth quarter. Is that a fair look forward into fiscal 2020 or is there an opportunity to bring that down even more?",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "Yeah. I think actually there was -- I read all of the initial preliminary reports this morning and I think there was a bit of confusion around the tax rate, so I'll just want to clarify what we meant and what's in the prepared remarks. So inclusive that the revision that we talked about in this quarter, we estimate that our fourth quarter tax rate will be between 22% to 22.5%. That means, the full-year 2019 tax rate would be between 26.5% and 27%. The 21% to 22% that we referred to is referencing 2020 onwards.",
        "Bill Katz -- Citi -- Analyst",
        "Great, Thank you very much. That's perfect. Thank you guys.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Carrier from Bank of America. Your line is now live.",
        "Mike Carrier -- Bank of America -- Analyst",
        "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First one, just on the expenses, Matt, you mentioned on the guidance for '20. I guess just maybe longer term and bigger picture, how are you thinking about your margins in the business over time just given the focus on efficiencies, yet some of the investments that you're making and some of the flow trends that you guys are facing currently?",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "Look we're obviously as a business focused on running our margins to go back up. I'm not going to give any guidance on that. I mean we have reported that if you exclude the non-recurring items that our margin is closer to 29% or just above 29%, we'd obviously like for it to be higher than that. But we can't let that impact what our long-term strategy as a company and the investments that we need to make to achieve some of the things that Jenny and Greg have talked about. We're very focused on investing for the future, while being incredibly disciplined around expenses. We already have a new budget process that we're putting in place right now. We've been working through that. And that is all about making sure that we stay on top of our expenses. But at the same time making sure we have enough investment dollars to recirculate into the business as I described a moment ago. And that's we're fairly comfortable with the guidance we're giving on 2020. Although, I should say it is early days.",
        "Mike Carrier -- Bank of America -- Analyst",
        "Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the flow side, I think you guys flagged few known institutional platform redemptions in July. Greg I think you mentioned they are maybe in that $4 billion range. And then on the growth side you guys mentioned the $2 billion pipeline and then some traction on the solutions. Maybe just provide an update and some additional color on where you're seeing like increased demand. You've given whether it's the performance that you're seeing in some of the products seeing improvement or some of the investments that you have made over the past few years and where you're starting to see more progress or traction there?",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah. I mean I think Jenny mentioned we made a pretty significant investment just to restructure some of the US retail and New York Stock Exchange focused generalization and more specialization and we saw pretty good pickup year-to-date there of about 24% I think or something. In sales, I think if you look at just market share despite flow numbers, I think in the last quarter something like four out of six or four out of five of our major categories, we picked up market share. And I think that's a result of a lot of different things that we've been doing -- that we've been talking about, I think over the last year that we've seen some additional investment there.",
        "I think where scale comes to play for a business, our size is really the business then of being in the solutions business in a real way and then taking all these capabilities into separately managed accounts or asset allocation and that's a big push right now that we think there's only a few people that can do that and we think that's going to continue to be a very strong growth area for the business outside of the traditional fund side, but I'll ask Jenny if she wants to add anything.",
        "Jennifer M. Johnson -- President and Chief Operating Officer",
        "Yeah. No, I think that's right. And I think the model portfolios -- we've had some wins on model portfolios and one of our advantages is that, we allow open architecture models, so we have some internally and sleeves that are internal with some portion external. And so having that real solutions business both with the breadth of capability that we have as a firm, as well as a due diligence team that can evaluate outside managers, I think has been given us that advantage in that area. And I think that the SMA business is an opportunity for us. It was just in the last four months that we got approval from our board to do some kind of completion type funds that we think can take a strategy like the income fund strategy and be able to sell it through the SMA channel. And so we think that that will pick up there.",
        "Mike Carrier -- Bank of America -- Analyst",
        "Okay. Thanks a lot.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.",
        "Alex Blostein -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst",
        "Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks. Just another one around M&A for you guys. Just your comments around targeting either kind of distribution channels or continue to expand in the alternative space have been pretty consistent for the last couple of quarters. Curious to get your thoughts on your appetite for deals for most of the traditional products where you might still have some product gaps, whether it's on the kind of core equity growth side or some of the fixed income core plus type of products or money market fund. So some of the gaps in some of the traditional products and the appetites there? Thanks.",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah. I just say all the above of your list. You hit it pretty, pretty accurately.",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "Yeah. Exactly I was going to say, I think one of the points I made earlier on was accelerating scale in certain investment objectives. We have practically everything, but there are some areas and you just referenced a couple of them right there that we should be much larger in. So, yes, we're very, very focused on this.",
        "Alex Blostein -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst",
        "Cool. Great, thanks. And then just a question around capital returns, I think in your release you talked about targeting 100% payout going forward. Is that on a GAAP net income basis, because you're non-operating could be pretty lumpy, so I'm just kind of curious how that plays into the kind of the more tactical capital returns given some of the volatility on the non-operating income side?",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "Yes. GAAP net income and target 100%.",
        "Alex Blostein -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst",
        "Great. Thanks so much.",
        "Operator",
        "Thanks. Our next question is coming from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.",
        "Brian Bedell -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst",
        "Great. Thanks very much. Most of my questions have been asked also, but maybe just one more on M&A. Some other areas that maybe a potential. I wanted to just to get your thoughts, any view on either quantitative strategies or smart beta scaling up your organic smart beta with an acquisition. And then also you mentioned some distribution in Europe whether there were certain geographies where you could do small acquisitions that you think you could scale into your organization and also get a lot of traction.",
        "So wrapping that together with the timing of M&A and the cash that you have, you've always been patient, obviously, with M&A, but is there a little bit more of a -- urgency is the wrong word, but sort of a pickup in appetite to deploy that cash sooner rather than later?",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "Yeah. I mean, we use the word action quite deliberately. I mean we're just being very active in assessing the various options that exist, but we're also focusing those down to a handful, instead of getting confused across too many places and to me investment objectives and so on. So we're focused on it.",
        "In terms of timing, we really -- we can't put a time on it. We can even put a label on what we're going to do immediately next, I think that would be a mistake to do that. These are complicated transactions where they are small, medium, or large candidly, but our observation is, and we've said this in our prepared remarks is that, there is a lot of strategic activity that's being discussed in the asset and wealth space and we are very well positioned to capitalize on that when we find something that fits well with us.",
        "So when that exactly is that, I don't think it's the right thing to comment on, but if we find something sooner rather than later, we will act upon it.",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "And I would just add too. I mean timing when you're making larger bets on asset classes. The performance and net flows will be secondary to what the markets do over the next cycle. So that's important, that's a hard thing to do, they anticipate but I think you just don't want to and then that's back to Matthew's point of not blowing out -- blowing the balance sheet up or your capital reserves by making a big bet on a market segment when we're near ten of the expansion. I think those are the factors that you have to weigh in to be prudent about where we make our strategic bets and I think if you see a smaller one less correlated you could move probably quicker or one where you use a little bit more equity in there to get new categories and get some scale out of it, that would work as well.",
        "Jennifer M. Johnson -- President and Chief Operating Officer",
        "And I'd be remiss, but I take this opportunity to plug the smart beta team that we have because, it's got stellar performance and it's been our fastest growth area in our ETF space as well as some of our separate accounts. So from that, I think that we would probably not be a buyer. We would continue to grow what we have.",
        "Brian Bedell -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst",
        "That's great color. Yeah. Maybe just one other unrelated follow-up would be on, Matthew, your view of potentially outsourcing some of the administrative and back office fund functions as opposed to running them internally. I know you've used the scale internally over a long-term period to maximize that, but is there any kind of change of view potentially in doing that going forward?",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "So we already announced the outsourcing of our fund administration as you know. And in fact that brings you back to answer the second part of Bill Katz's question which I didn't answer, which was about the cost savings that we announced of between, I think, we said between $80 million and $85 million and I just want to be clear, I think those question was, how much of that we going to achieve in 2020. I think the answer for that is, about $70 million to $75 million fully in 2020 -- fiscal 2020 that is.",
        "The reason why there is 10 missing from that is the other 10 is associated with the fund administration outsourcing, which we expect to save around that amount from 2021, because obviously that takes some time to implement. In terms of going further than that, we don't intend to outsource anything else at this time, but of course we continue to review our options around technology to be as efficient as we can. But right now...",
        "Jennifer M. Johnson -- President and Chief Operating Officer",
        "Well, I would just say that our philosophy hasn't been necessarily that it has to be in-house or outsourced, it has been in many ways it-you do it as efficiently and cost effectively as you can. It was historically difficult to find outsourced providers that have the global footprint that we do. And because we were aggressive in leveraging low cost locations to support our business, it was -- it didn't make sense economically to do it, that is changing over time. And as that evolves, we always look at what makes the most sense for this business. So it is something we evaluate. And that's where we concluded with the fund administration, although we had looked at that many times before and concluded, it wasn't cost-effective at that point. But now the things have changed.",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah. And also, earlier on there wasn't a provider that existed that could serve what we needed to be served in front of administrations for that change. So we took the action that we did. So same thing happens with transfer agency, in the future maybe that changes our view of that.",
        "Brian Bedell -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst",
        "And is fund accounting looped in with fund administration?",
        "Jennifer M. Johnson -- President and Chief Operating Officer",
        "Yes, yes.",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",

        "Brennan Hawken -- UBS -- Analyst",
        "Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, just one here. So, you guys have spoken a bit about the elevated quarter day redemptions and some of these strategies. Did these strategies happen to overlap with any of the organizational changes and staffing adjustments that you flagged to PM teams?",
        "Jennifer M. Johnson -- President and Chief Operating Officer",
        "Did the redemptions have, is that -- is your question, did the -- were the redemption specifically the results of the organizational changes? If that's your question, no, the redemption...",
        "Brennan Hawken -- UBS -- Analyst",
        "Or did they just overlap with the PM teams that were impacted by those adjustments?",
        "Jennifer M. Johnson -- President and Chief Operating Officer",
        "They did overlap, but they would -- for example, one of the large redemptions was a result of a firm that had been acquired in the decision for them to bring the asset management business in-house. So while it was, I believe, a global equity mandate, it wasn't correlated to anything to do with the PM changes. It was really because they had made a strategic decision to bring the assets in-house.",
        "Brennan Hawken -- UBS -- Analyst",
        "Okay. Got it.",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "And most of these changes were announced just recently. So it wouldn't be reflected in this quarter anyway on the PM changes.",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "Yes, I was referring to...",
        "Brennan Hawken -- UBS -- Analyst",
        "Oh, you were saying that as a result of the redemptions? You're making these changes that...",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "No, I was referring to the July color but I'm thinking that maybe, there might be something...",
        "Brennan Hawken -- UBS -- Analyst",
        "All right. All right. Okay.",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah, I mean, I think we expect some, but I think at the end of the day, this category, the devalued categories just under tremendous pressure of underperforming core and growth over the cycle. So I think the people that are left believe that this is a safe way to protect the portfolio that you really have, you've read the article, you have never seen more common holdings across active managers today than ever, where the 50 top stocks are held by just about every fund. That's not the case with these, and I think, there are investors who like the fact that, you own a portfolio at 12, 13 times earnings and much more defensive and I would say Templeton today, if anything in the last quarter even got more defensive in their positioning where markets are. So I think at the end of the day, they will stand out, when you have a downturn or rent interest rates rise and growth is under pressure.",
        "Brennan Hawken -- UBS -- Analyst",
        "Yeah. Those of us that cover financials can commiserate.",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yes.",
        "Brennan Hawken -- UBS -- Analyst",
        "Thanks for taking the questions.",

        "Thank you.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is now live.",
        "Robert Lee -- KBW -- Analyst",
        "Great. Thanks. Thanks for your patience. And Matt, welcome and good luck. Just a real quick question most of mine been asked, but going back to the recurring M&A and strategic and organic growth. I'm just curious as you think about it, are there any change in terms of your willingness to think of in a different ownership structures. I mean historically, like with benefits treat pretty much of -- then 100% acquirers, some competitors are more willing to do majority ownership transaction. So as you think of the landscape, maybe particularly in the alternative space, there are also a shift taking place and your willingness us to think of different structures than you've done historically?",
        "Jennifer M. Johnson -- President and Chief Operating Officer",
        "Well, I'll say that there's -- we have some situations of joint ventures, I mean, actually, internationally, there'll be markets where we make decisions around, it's better to partner than it is to own 100% because maybe it's a difficult market for a foreign manager. So we have an openness to that. Having said that, one of the things that has made us successful with acquisitions is that, we keep the independence of the investment team, and we take advantage and leverage all the support capabilities. And that's where you get real scale out of it.",
        "And so, when you leave it independent and you see it with managers out there, you don't get that benefit. And you get confusion around distribution and you get a lack of commitment, and the conversation doesn't get as focused on the investment team. But obviously in the alternative business you have to structure compensation appropriately even when you have 100% ownership. So we're cognizant of that. And if it made sense we would do it, so like I said, we're not completely against it, but it is complicated to try to manage a JV much more so than it is when you have a 100% ownership.",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah. And I think that's probably a great summary to say on the distribution side, somebody brought up or you opened and we've talked about that. And certainly minority stake in a captive market with captive distribution for a platform makes a lot of sense to own. But as Jenny said, I think creating a corporate culture and integrating and getting really all the leverage from what we offer as a global platform from a distribution and servicing side is very difficult when you own 60% or 70%, it just gets very complicated. You spend a lot of energy on things that really are not that production.",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "Yeah. I mean subscale transactions along those lines really don't make any sense to us at all. And I think anything around M&A, from a financial perspective, this is sort of needless to say in a way, but we would expect the margin to be accretive to us. So we are absolutely driven around M&A by growth and diversification versus cost cutting, but obviously some of the larger transactions do come with very significant margin improvement opportunities.",
        "Robert Lee -- KBW -- Analyst",
        "Great. I appreciate the color. Thank you.",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "Thanks, Rob.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.",
        "Michael Cyprys -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst",
        "Hey, good morning. Thanks for your clarifications and taking the question. So you've made some senior-level additions and organizational changes. I guess as you look forward from here, what additional hiring are you making and other potential changes that could make sense next as you're focused on optimizing the cost structure, but also investing for growth? And related to that, as you're thinking about the pace of expense growth beyond 2020, would you envision that being more in line with inflation, how should we be thinking about that?",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Well, I would start with -- I mean I think we've made a significant number of hires. I don't think there's anything on the horizon right now that say there's a big gap here or there that -- and I think we spent a lot of time working on succession, and that's the norm for any CIO transitions. So I don't think we have any big plans of adding senior people in the area.",
        "Matthew Nicholls -- Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer",
        "Yeah. And I think our cost structure will be guided based on how we're doing in the business overall, and where we need to invest, and how we're growing or not.",
        "Michael Cyprys -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst",
        "Great. And just a follow-up, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about your approach in China to sourcing growth there, how that approach is evolving just given some of the recent regulatory changes? I understand you have a JV in China. Is the focus more with the JV partner or any appetite for building outside of the JV, and any sort of color you could share around AUM, flows, staffing, any progress that you can share? Thank you",
        "Jennifer M. Johnson -- President and Chief Operating Officer",
        "So we do have a JV, and we're excited about the opportunity to be able to acquire a 100%, and so that -- they've accelerated the pace of that, so we're certainly looking at that. We also have a [Indecipherable] there where we have some investment personnel that are out of there, as well as some kind of support distribution side. The JV has great investment performance, and so they've seen some good flows there. It's a difficult market, and it's always more complicated when you're in a JV structure, so we think that there is just great opportunity to own a 100%, and continue to try to grow in China.",
        "Gregory E. Johnson -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer",
        "And it's about $4 billion to $5 billion, so it's not included in our AUM, and it is profitable, the JV today, but not of the size where we'd like it to be.",
        "Michael Cyprys -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst",
        "Okay. Thank you.",

        "Could the setup \" be \" any more perfect in Campbell Soup (NYSE: CPB ) for earnings?",
        "Okay, so moving on from our very touching Friends tribute as it approaches its 25-year anniversary in a few weeks, the setup really was perfect in CPB.",
        "Shares were forming a tight ascending triangle, a bullish technical pattern where rising uptrend support squeezes the stock against a static level of resistance. That resistance was in play around $42.50.",
        "CPB exploded over that level on Friday, racing up to $48 where it hit stiff, multi-year resistance.",
        "I would love to see the stock maintain above the 200-week moving average now and build on its recent momentum in the holiday-shortened trading week to start September. If it can, look to see if we get another run up to $48. On a retreat, see that $42.50 holds as support, as well as the 10-week moving average. ",
        "Ambarella (NASDAQ: AMBA ) is also putting together a strong rally on Friday, up almost 20% on the day. The move vaults shares over $50 resistance and the 200-day moving average at $48.80.",
        "Bulls now must see these two levels hold as support. Further, the stock now has room to rally up to $65, another 15% above current levels.",
        "First it was up, then it was down, then Marvel Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL ) was near flat going into Friday's close.",
        "The stock was rejected by the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, as well as downtrend resistance (blue line). Investors now need to see $23 hold as support. If it holds, a retest of resistance is in the cards.",
        "If it fails, the May lows at $21.25 may be on the table. Further, the 200-day is down at $21 and rising, while the 50% retracement is near $21 as well. Over $25 and MRVL can gain upside momentum.",

        "Bulls now needs to maintain above $50 and the 20-day moving average. If they can, it will increase the odds of taking out Friday's high, and thus the 50-day moving average and 61.8% retracement. From there, it puts $58 back on the table.",
        "Bears need to crack $50 and the 20-day, putting $46 back on the table.",
        "Like Dell, Big Lots (NYSE: BIG ) is bouncing between a few key levels on the charts. Unlike Dell though, BIG is not ending the day on a high note. Shares are up more than 2% and above $22.50, but are well off session highs at $25.74.",
        "Shares were promptly rejected from the key $25.50 to $26 area, as well as the 50-day moving average.",

        "By Sofia Menchu and Diego Or\u00e9",
        "GUATEMALA CITY, Aug 30 (Reuters) - In late August, U.N. officials, judges and civil society leaders met in Guatemala to say farewell to a U.N. commission that fought political corruption before its mandate was terminated by President Jimmy Morales.",
        "High-level figures were conspicuously absent. Neither Morales nor his ministers, congressional powerbrokers nor top business leaders attended.",
        "The agency's ouster has enflamed tensions sparked by CICIG's crusade against graft, a chronic malaise in Guatemala, and has caused profound unease among the judges who will inherit its mantle.",
        "Without the CICIG, widely viewed as one of the most successful anti-corruption bodies in Latin American history, judges told Reuters they feared it would be difficult to proceed with cases because of threats, staff cuts and a lack of political power.",
        "\"The fight against corruption has been weakened,\" said Haroldo Vasquez, president of Guatemala'sAssociation of Judges for Integrity. \"Justice and judicial independence are not issues that interest many people in the government.\"",
        "Since launching in 2007, the CICIG helped strengthen courts and professionalized the attorney general's office. It brought down the last president and almost toppled Morales by accusing him of breaking campaign finance laws.",
        "In return, Morales accused the CICIG of abuse of power and set about expelling it, ultimately allowing its mandate to expire.",
        "The CICIG still has popular approval, with 72% of Guatemalans saying it should remain, according to a recent survey of about 1,200 people by local research firm Prodatos.",
        "However, Giammattei wants to let the CICIG mandate expire in September and create a local anti-corruption body, saying the U.N. commission's future had already been decided. Describing the problem in Guatemala as \"the system,\" he said the causes of corruption are what must be attacked. ",
        "Many view the idea as an uphill battle.",
        "\"The setback for justice will also negatively impact the economy and governance,\" Ivan Velasquez, the CICIG's head, said at the farewell event.",
        "Moody's has called the CICIG's exit negative for Guatemala's sovereign credit rating. The International Monetary Fund has warned that \"drifting anti-corruption efforts\" could hurt investment.",
        "REVENGE IS SWEET",
        "The CICIG's team began life with a bold experiment: working with the attorney general's office to combat criminal networks entrenched after more than 30 years of civil war.",
        "Then-President Oscar Berger welcomed the group, recognizing that weak institutions and extensive corruption were dragging down the Central American nation's fragile democracy.",
        "After the CICIG took on presidents, judges, cabinet members and lawmakers, its exit leaves 70 cases in limbo that are due to be passed to the Special Prosecutor Against Impunity (FECI), a local office designed to combat corruption.",
        "But CICIG investigators and judges said the cases were transferred haphazardly, or not at all. CICIG spokesman Matias Ponce says the FECI did not absorb any CICIG lawyers.",
        "Juan Francisco Sandoval, the head of the FECI, said the process of transferring capacity to the unit began in 2007 and had yielded results. However, he conceded that taking on the CICIG's cases was \"very complex.\"",
        "\"The CICIG in Guatemala acted as a lightning rod to weather storms for the attorney general's office,\" he said.",
        "Hearings will likely be patchy due to fewer staff and a lack of experience in complex cases, Judge Miguel Angel Galvez said.",
        "Judges, CICIG investigators and ex-prosecutors hope Giammattei will at least guarantee judicial independence.",
        "\"We have to keep fighting,\" Vasquez, of Judges for Integrity, said. \"We're here until the end because that's all we know.\"",
        "But intimidation has already begun, judges say.",
        "\"We've seen messages saying they want us dead,\" said Judge Erika Aifan, one of dozens in the justice system who say threats have intensified, ranging from menacing phone calls to pressure from colleagues to drop cases.",
        "Responding to the reports of intimidation, Attorney General Consuelo Porras said this week that any credible threats against judges would be investigated.",
        "A politician who was imprisoned after a CICIG investigation, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said some people burned by the CICIG now sense a chance for revenge.",
        "\"In politics, if you're going to attack, you should never leave the wounded behind,\" he said. \"Now we have the list of investigators and prosecutors who are going to pay for being such bad people with all of us.\""

The 2019 outlook for West Texas Intermediate crude futures was slashed to the weakest level since January 2018, at $57.90 per barrel, below last month's $59.29 outlook.",

That would put millions of people at risk along with big vacation parks such as Walt Disney World, the NASA launchpads along the Space Coast, and even President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach.",

        "CHICAGO, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Illinois bonds traded higher on Friday following a judge's decision preventing a constitutional challenge to $16 billion of the state's debt from proceeding.",
        "In the wake of Thursday's ruling by Sangamon County Circuit Court Associate Judge Jack Davis II, prices rose and yields tumbled on Illinois general obligation bonds sold in 2003 and 2017 that were targeted in a taxpayer petition filed in July. ",
        "The release on Thursday of Illinois' fiscal 2018 financial audit, which showed an improvement in the state's still-hefty structural budget deficit, also comforted the U.S. municipal bond market, according to Peter Franks, senior market analyst at Municipal Market Data (MMD). ",
        "Because of its deep financial woes, Illinois has the lowest credit ratings and pays the biggest yield penalty among states.",
        "Franks said Illinois' so-called credit spread over MMD's benchmark triple-A yield scale for 10-year bonds will be lowered 10 basis points to 165 basis points on Friday as a result of the trading.",
        "Since the petition's filing, the spread had widened from 139 basis points on July 1 to 175 basis points as of Thursday.",
        "The petition claimed bonds Illinois sold in 2003 and 2017 violated the state constitution because the proceeds boosted funding for state retirement systems or paid overdue bills instead of being used for specific purposes like capital improvements.",
        "Plaintiffs, including John Tillman, CEO of conservative think tank Illinois Policy Institute, had sought the court's permission to file a taxpayer lawsuit against state officials to stop billions of dollars in future payments on the approximately $14.35 billion of bonds that remain outstanding.",
        "In the ruling denying the petition, which Tillman plans to appeal, the judge said the plaintiffs' arguments were more political than legal in nature.",
        "Meanwhile, Illinois reported that it ended fiscal 2018 with a $7.8 billion general fund budget deficit, an improvement of nearly 50% from the state's record $14.6 billion gap in fiscal 2017."

      "title": "10 Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips",
        "For some investors, mid-cap stocks are a perfect hunting ground for stocks to buy. Small-cap stocks offer more volatility - and generally have underperformed in this bull market. Large-cap stocks often have so much coverage that finding a real buying opportunity is difficult.",
        "So mid-cap stocks - defined here as those with a market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion - offer a nice balance. The companies are large enough to own significant market share, and provide steady performance. They can be small enough to, on occasion, dip below the market's radar.",
        "Among the 1,000-plus mid-cap stocks on U.S. markets, these 10 look like potentially the best stocks to buy. They span different industries - and have very different risk/reward profiles. But all 10, at the least, have a strong bull case.",
        "To be clear, marijuana producer Tilray (NASDAQ: TLRY ) is not for the faint of heart. It may not even be a buy just yet, as the chart of TLRY stock is a classic falling knife.",
        "This, after all, is a stock that looked like a bubble less than a year ago. TLRY stock went from $20 to $300 in a matter of weeks. Since then, shares have done nothing but fall.",
        "That crazy trading likely colors Tilray stock in the mind of some investors. And with cannabis sentiment clearly negative, particularly among the larger names , it continues to be the victim of a steady sell-off. A Q2 report this month that investors took as disappointing certainly didn't help.",
        "But as I wrote after earnings, there's actually an interesting strategic play here . Tilray is staying patient, focusing on cannabis derivatives instead of producing flower whose price it believes will eventually crater. Given plunging prices in legalized U.S. markets like Oregon and Colorado, that strategy makes some sense.",
        "Again, the chart here is ugly, and patience might be advised. Investors skeptical of cannabis growth should look elsewhere. But even investors intrigued by the space seem to see Tilray as some sort of fly-by-night pump stock after last year's bubble. It's not. And at some point, TLRY stock will bottom - and could see a nice rebound.",
        "There aren't a lot of growth stocks to buy in the mid-cap stocks space at the moment. Some of the best stories in recent years - think Shopify (NYSE: SHOP ), Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU ), or The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD ) - have been discovered, and their market caps have moved above $10 billion.",
        "Meanwhile, with many markets 'winner take most', those growth stories that aren't the best stories simply may not be attractive. A software stock, for instance, that is second or third in its market usually isn't a true growth stock.",
        "But CyberArk Software (NASDAQ: CYBR ) seems like an exception. As Will Healy detailed in January, CyberArk has a solid niche in the growing cybersecurity space. Revenue growth of 21% in 2017 accelerated to 31% last year, and CyberArk is guiding for a 22-23% increase this year on top of that strong comparison.",
        "At 43x 2020 EPS estimates, CYBR stock isn't necessarily cheap. But that figure drops below 40x backing out the company's $13 per share in cash. And a recent 23% pullback from late July highs makes the price more attractive. That decline came in part due to Q2 earnings earlier this month - yet the report looked strong, with a guidance hike.",
        "That selloff comes in a market where investors still see growth plays as stocks to buy almost no matter the valuation. If CYBR gets that treatment again, the upside from current levels could be enormous.",
        "There also aren't a lot of 'set it and forget it' consumer plays in the mid-cap space - or the market at all. Retailers, save for the biggest companies, have been hammered. Suppliers face risk as well, as fragmented markets mean smaller companies can take share.",
        "But through that noise, Columbia Sportswear (NASDAQ: COLM ) just keeps performing. Columbia is coming off a second quarter report in July where it crushed earnings estimates and raised full-year guidance. Yet it trades at just 18x the midpoint of that guidance, backing out net cash.",
        "This indeed seems like a 'set it and forget it' play. It's well-managed. The Columbia brand has real value. The need for outdoor wear is unlikely to decline. And the combination of a reasonable valuation and strong growth provides a compelling entry point below $100.",
        "Airline stocks like JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU ) can be difficult investments. Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ,NYSE: BRK.B ) famously ignored the space for years before entering the sector in 2016.",
        "Buffett's prior logic was that airlines had too much cyclical exposure, capital needs that were too intensive, and too often went bankrupt. Those worries still cloud the space: most airline stocks, including JBLU, are quite cheap on an earnings basis as investors discount the impact of a potentially looming recession.",
        "So anyone even considering an airline stock has to have some faith in the U.S. macro picture. But as far as the sector goes, JBLU looks like the best choice. It has the lowest international exposure - and thus the biggest reliance on an American economy that is leading the world at the moment. As an analyst noted this week, its costs are under control, and its valuation on a P/E basis is well below historical averages .",
        "To be sure, JBLU stock probably will always look cheap. And it's traded sideways for years now. But at the low end of that range, and at just 7x 2020 EPS estimates, JetBlue stock might finally be too cheap.",
        "Industrial distributors like HD Supply (NYSE: HDS ), too, are being discounted for cyclical reasons. But even in that context, HDS stock looks too cheap.",
        "HDS trades at less than 11x the midpoint of FY19 EPS guidance. Admittedly, the company did cut that outlook after Q2 results, with weather and some one-time issues a factor. But this is a company still growing revenue at a sharp clip, with sales guided to increase roughly 7% this year.",
        "In other words, HD Supply is growing in line with other plays like Fastenal (NASDAQ: FAST ) or MSM Industrial Direct (NYSE: MSM ) - yet it's valued at a discount. Here, too, investors bullish on the U.S. economy have an attractive option at a reasonable valuation.",
        "There are two big worries with Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE: SMG ). The first is that the easy money has been made. The second is that it looked the way before, too - and SMG stock promptly plunged.",
        "Indeed, SMG stock soared to an all-time high in 2017 on the back of cannabis optimism. Two acquisitions had positioned the company to be a key supplier to the industry.",
        "But execution was lacking. Scotts Miracle-Gro's CEO even held an expletive-laden conference call to express his frustration with the marijuana-facing Hawthorne unit.",
        "Since then, however, Scotts Miracle-Gro seems back on track. And the stock reflects that: SMG shares have risen 74% so far this year. Some of that increase is coming from better execution. But some might be coming from increasing optimism that a stronger Hawthorne unit can better benefit from cannabis growth in Canada and the U.S.",
        "And that is a risk, particularly with SMG trading at 24x the midpoint of FY19 earnings guidance. But there also are huge growth opportunities here, both in the cannabis space and in the traditional lawn care category. If Scotts can take advantage of those opportunities, the stock can move higher. And recent performance suggests that it will.",
        "Shares of Mohawk Industries (NYSE: MHK ) just bounced off a six-year low - and perhaps for good reason.",
        "The company's own CEO called the environment \"difficult\" in the company's Q2 release in July. Luxury vinyl tile (LVT) is an opportunity for Mohawk - but also a challenge, as it cannibalizes existing sales in ceramic and porcelain tile.",
        "But there's a case to buy the dip here. Mohawk isn't terribly leveraged, with debt-to-EBITDA under 2x even after disappointing first-half results. P/E is under 11x. LVT start-up costs are hitting earnings now - but that category should at some point should turn from a headwind to earnings to a tailwind.",
        "In an environment where housing-related stocks have rallied after an ugly 2018 , MHK has been left out. That should reverse - if the company can capitalize on the LVT opportunity.",
        "U.S. gaming stocks like Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ: PENN ) and Boyd Gaming (NYSE: BYD ) have taken a reasonably big hit so far in 2019 - despite what seems like good news.",
        "The U.S. economy remains strong. Earnings are still growing. The legalization of sports betting isn't quite the boost to profits that some investors might think - as executives at both companies have pointed out - but it still should drive higher visitation and provide help to hotel and food & beverage revenue.",
        "And yet, shares of domestic casino operators keep falling. PENN shares touched a two-year low in August. BYD is down 40% from early February highs.",
        "Here, too, investors need to trust the macro environment. Casino stocks are notoriously cyclical - and that goes double for Penn National, who has leased most of its properties to REIT Gaming & Leisure Properties (NASDAQ: GLPI ).",
        "But high risk also implies high reward - and both stocks can soar. Valuation, in terms of both P/E and EV/EBITDA, is cheap. Demand remains strong. Competition from new U.S. states is likely to be minimal, with no new major markets on the horizon. Both companies can pay down debt and, in the case of Boyd, pay dividends as well. There's a lot to like - if the external environment cooperates.",
        "The case against a mall-based retailer like American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE: AEO ) is easy to make. Mall traffic continues to decline. The shift to 'omnichannel retailing' may work for the likes of Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) and Target (NYSE: TGT ), for smaller subscale specialty retailers simply results in lower margins and smaller earnings.",
        "But American Eagle isn't your standard mall retailer. The legacy nameplate continues to drive positive same-store sales and solid online growth, a combination few of its rivals can match. Meanwhile, its aerie unit continues to take market share from L Brands (NYSE: LB ) unit Victoria's Secret.",
        "There's not much reason to see either of trends ending any time soon. American Eagle's denim business is benefiting from a resurgence in that category. Weakness at rival Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE: ANF ) and Aeropostale suggests market share gains should continue. Aerie continues to post double-digit growth in same-store sales. Its positioning as an 'honest', body-positive brand against Victoria's Secret's 'angels' should continue to drive even more market share capture.",
        "And yet, AEO stock has been dragged by a market selling anything related to malls - including operators like Simon Property Group (NYSE: SPG ) and Macerich (NYSE: MAC ). While there's some logic to the bearish sentiment, American Eagle has proven itself to be an outlier. At less than 10x forward earnings, and with a 3.2% dividend yield, it's not being treated as such. When that changes - and it should - AEO stock will prove to be one of the best stocks to buy out there.",
        "As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.",

        " Value investing is about picking stocks that are trading below their intrinsic value. It should have been easy enough to do, through a comparison of the price to earnings multiple of the company and its peer group (or the S&P 500), or any other criterion you prefer to use for comparison. But of course it isn't that simple, or everyone would have been doing it. The tricky part is in understanding the fair valuation of the stock you're considering. Because, for all you know, the company doesn't have very bright prospects, or there are some big-time headwinds it's facing that aren't affecting the others in the group. And that's what could be keeping the pressure on prices. So how so we know whether a stock is worth putting money into? Obviously, in the current scenario, where there are significant market uncertainties, regular recession warnings and trade war concerns, as well as elevated share prices, one thing you want to avoid is getting into stocks that are headed down. Or extremely risky ventures like Tesla for example, that could either silence all critics or fall flat on its face. True, value investing is for the long haul, you aren't expecting to get rich overnight. But you just don't want to get caught in something like that. So what you basically need is a tried and tested formula that will fetch you guaranteed returns.

      "title": "Manitowoc (MTW) Down 17% Year to Date: Will It Bounce Back? - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "  The Manitowoc Company  's MTW  focus on product innovation, solid aftermarket business, cost control, improving productivity and pricing actions are commendable. However, shares of the company have lost 16.8% year to date compared with the industry  's decline of 7.3%. This downside can be primarily attributed to muted customer spending on account of the ongoing trade disputes and geopolitical uncertainties.    makeArticleAd();  Let's delve deeper.  What Dragged the Stock Down?  Manitowoc's orders in the first half of 2019 were $813.0 million, a 16% drop year over year as customers became more cautious as a result of uncertain market conditions. Manitowoc's backlog as of second quarter end was $561 million, down 19% year over year. Trade disputes and other macro-economic factors continue to create uncertainty in  global market  s. Additionally, the U.S. and European construction markets are slowing and U.S. rate counts have declined. All these factors are affecting customer sentiment.    Further, fluctuating foreign exchange rates are putting pressure on Manitowoc's margins, particularly on European-produced cranes that it sells in the United States. The Middle East market also remains challenging owing to geopolitical uncertainties and market competitions.    Additionally, Manitowoc continues to witness inflation in material costs, which includes the impact of tariffs. This is affecting the company's margins. Further, supply chain challenges continue to be a headwind.  Factors Likely to Drive Growth  Manitowoc continues to execute its strategy to cover cost inflation through pricing actions. The company also remains focused on cost controls, reducing headcount, increasing productivity and eliminating waste. It is also taking proactive steps to support supply chain partners to ensure timely delivery of components, combined with alternative sourcing strategies. Manitowoc has also provided own in-house labor to weld the finished components to keep production lines flowing. This will support its financial goals.    Manitowoc's aftermarket business continues to perform well. Growth is primarily stemming from higher-margin parts and services. The company remains focused on improving this crucial part of the business. Further, the company noted that there is scope of improving the Middle East revenues. It continues to strengthen partnerships with its channel partners in the region to capitalize on the recovery in the markets. Manitowoc's focus on innovation by providing differentiated products that add value to customers will strengthen the company's industry leading position.    Manitowoc's long-term outlook remains strong. The company continues to be committed to achieving its target of double-digit operating margins improvement year over year. In fact, the company anticipates achieving long-term target of double-digit operating margins by 2020 through continued streamlining organizational structure. We believe that these factors will eventually benefit Manitowoc's results and drive a turnaround in its share price.  Zacks Rank & Key Picks  Manitowoc currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).    A few better-ranked stocks in the Industrial Products  sector are Zebra Technologies Corp. ZBRA  , Avery Dennison Corp. AVY  and Tetra Tech, Inc. TTEK  . While Zebra Technologies currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Avery Dennison and Tetra Tech carry a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .    Zebra Technologies has a projected earnings growth rate of 16.71% for the current year. The stock has gained 21% in a year.    Avery Dennison has an estimated earnings growth rate of 8.42% for 2019. The company's shares have gone up 9.3% in the past year.

        " The Manitowoc Company  's MTW  focus on product innovation, solid aftermarket business, cost control, improving productivity and pricing actions are commendable. However, shares of the company have lost 16.8% year to date compared with the industry  's decline of 7.3%. This downside can be primarily attributed to muted customer spending on account of the ongoing trade disputes and geopolitical uncertainties.",
        "   makeArticleAd();  Let's delve deeper.",
        " What Dragged the Stock Down? ",
        "Manitowoc's orders in the first half of 2019 were $813.0 million, a 16% drop year over year as customers became more cautious as a result of uncertain market conditions. Manitowoc's backlog as of second quarter end was $561 million, down 19% year over year. Trade disputes and other macro-economic factors continue to create uncertainty in  global market  s. Additionally, the U.S. and European construction markets are slowing and U.S. rate counts have declined. All these factors are affecting customer sentiment.    Further, fluctuating foreign exchange rates are putting pressure on Manitowoc's margins, particularly on European-produced cranes that it sells in the United States. The Middle East market also remains challenging owing to geopolitical uncertainties and market competitions.    Additionally, Manitowoc continues to witness inflation in material costs, which includes the impact of tariffs. This is affecting the company's margins. Further, supply chain challenges continue to be a headwind.",
        " Factors Likely to Drive Growth ",
        "Manitowoc continues to execute its strategy to cover cost inflation through pricing actions. The company also remains focused on cost controls, reducing headcount, increasing productivity and eliminating waste. It is also taking proactive steps to support supply chain partners to ensure timely delivery of components, combined with alternative sourcing strategies. Manitowoc has also provided own in-house labor to weld the finished components to keep production lines flowing. This will support its financial goals.    Manitowoc's aftermarket business continues to perform well. Growth is primarily stemming from higher-margin parts and services. The company remains focused on improving this crucial part of the business. Further, the company noted that there is scope of improving the Middle East revenues. It continues to strengthen partnerships with its channel partners in the region to capitalize on the recovery in the markets. Manitowoc's focus on innovation by providing differentiated products that add value to customers will strengthen the company's industry leading position.    Manitowoc's long-term outlook remains strong. The company continues to be committed to achieving its target of double-digit operating margins improvement year over year. In fact, the company anticipates achieving long-term target of double-digit operating margins by 2020 through continued streamlining organizational structure.",
        "We believe that these factors will eventually benefit Manitowoc's results and drive a turnaround in its share price.",

        "By Stephanie Kelly",
        "NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Oil futures fell on Friday, with U.S. crude down nearly 3% ahead of a hurricane near the Florida coast that could dampen demand, but prices were still headed for the biggest weekly increase since early July, boosted by an easing of U.S.-China trade rhetoric.",
        "Brent crude  futures fell 65 cents, or 1.1%, to settle at $60.43 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude  futures settled down $1.61, or 2.8%, at $55.10 a barrel.",
        "\"The latest modeling has Hurricane Dorian avoiding the Gulf of Mexico, while raking the entire state of Florida, turning it into a demand destruction event for the energy market rather than a supply disruption event,\" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital in New York.",
        "U.S. crude oil output fell for a second straight month in June, dropping by 33,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 12.08 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report released on Friday. ",
        "In an indication of future production, U.S. energy firms cut 12 oil rigs in the week to Aug. 30, bringing the total count down to 742, General Electric Co's  Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. The rig count declined for the ninth straight month to its lowest level since January last year. ",
        "Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' oil output rose 80,000 barrels per day in August, the first monthly increase this year, a Reuters survey found. ",
        "OPEC, Russia and other nonmembers, an alliance known as OPEC+, agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd in 2019. Russia's oil output in August was slightly higher than levels agreed under its output deal with OPEC+, but Moscow is still aiming to comply fully with the deal, RIA and Interfax news agencies cited Energy Minister Alexander Novak as saying. ",
        "Oil prices have fallen around 20% since they hit a 2019 peak in April, in part because of concerns that the U.S.-China trade war could hurt the global economy and soften demand for oil.",
        "In August alone, Brent posted a monthly drop of 7.3%, and WTI fell by 6%.",
        "This week, however, WTI gained by 1.7% and Brent by 1.8%, in part due to hopes that trade tensions between the world's two biggest oil consumers are easing.",
        "Chinese and U.S. trade negotiating teams are maintaining effective communication, China'sForeign Ministry said on Friday at a daily news briefing in Beijing. ",
        "Analysts polled by Reuters slashed price forecasts for Brent to an average of $65.02 in 2019 - the lowest in more than 16 months - citing softening global demand brought on by an economic slowdown and the trade war. ",

      "title": "4 Unexpected Costs to Plan for During Pregnancy - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "Pregnancy comes with some surprise expenses you may have to pay. Here are a few costs you should be sure to plan for.",
        "Image source: Getty Images",
        "Everyone knows that kids are expensive and that making a comprehensive financial plan is essential for new parents . But did you know that pregnancy itself can also come with some big costs?",
        "Of course, there are the obvious expenses such as buying maternity clothing and paying for copays on doctor visits. But as I discovered recently when I got pregnant with my first child, there are some costs many people don't think about that have to be paid -- and those can really add up.",
        "To help you avoid some surprises in your own budget, here are four costs I didn't plan for during my pregnancy that you may want to prepare for.",
        "Eating for two is a real thing -- you get a lot hungrier when pregnant. And even if you thought you had a pretty healthy diet before, chances are good you will change your eating habits when you're pregnant to make sure you get everything the baby needs. In fact, when I went to my midwife and was given a recommended meal plan, I was shocked by the number of servings of fruits, veggies, whole grains, and proteins I was supposed to be eating every single day.",
        "Buying everything to eat that baby apparently needs has definitely increased our food budget by quite a bit. And while not everyone can afford to follow meal guidelines to the letter, you should still expect you'll incur added costs for food -- if for no other reason than to satisfy your cravings.",
        "It probably comes as no surprise that being pregnant means seeing the doctor a lot.",
        "While I had just a few visits during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, I've been seeing my midwife with increasing frequency as the pregnancy progresses. In the second trimester, its normal to begin seeing your medical professional about every four weeks. And visits become increasingly frequent until you have to go to appointments just about every week as baby's arrival date gets closer.",
        "Since I'm a freelance writer, I don't get paid unless I'm working, so all these visits definitely reduced my earning capacity. And for those with no paid vacation, the same thing is likely to happen -- your income will take a hit. Even for parents lucky enough to have vacation time, chances are good you'll want to save it to spend with your baby so you may also be in the same boat with taking unpaid leave for all the doctor visits that happen during working hours.",
        "If you have coverage through an Obamacare-compliant health insurance policy, you should have at least some coverage for prenatal care. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean that there are no costs to pay for services.",
        "Sadly, even if you research your plan carefully, chances are good you'll still face some unexpected costs for out-of-network services. In my case, I had to have some early lab work and ultrasounds because I traveled overseas early in my pregnancy -- and I was surprised to discover upon my return home that the bloodwork was processed by an out-of-network lab even though I went to an in-network doctor. That meant higher fees to pay, and the out-of-network care counted towards a separate deductible.",
        "Many families also face similar problems on a much larger scale after a hospital delivery. When you're in labor, you're probably not going to take the time to check that everyone who enters your hospital room is in-network. And if you end up seeing, for example, an out-of-network anesthesiologist at an in-network hospital, you may face a huge surprise cost for that all-important epidural.",
        "When your baby arrives, you get the excitement of meeting this whole new person. Unfortunately, as a whole new person, your baby counts as a separate policyholder on your insurance coverage. This means that even if you met your deductible with your prenatal care, your new family member likely has a deductible of his or her own to meet.",
        "If your baby receives medical services after birth, you may have to cover these costs until the deductible has been met for your child. If you didn't realize your baby would be billed separately for care, this could mean a surprise set of bills you didn't plan for.",
        "Ideally, you should set aside some money for surprise expenses before you get pregnant. This cash can cover both costs during pregnancy as well as unexpected expenditures that are sure to happen when baby comes into the world. If you have spare cash to pay for surprise bills, you won't have to worry about money at a time when you're trying to enjoy your new bundle of joy.",

      "text": [
        "Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and \"initiate coverage\" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...",
        "Well, that seemed fast!",
        "Just 25 days ago, Hong Kong-based investment bank AMTD International (NYSE: HKIB) made its public debut \u00a0on the NYSE. Twenty-five days later, AMTD already has its first buy rating.",
        "And wouldn't you know it? The recommendation came from one of the bankers who underwrote AMTD International's IPO!",
        "Now, as new as AMTD International is to the public markets, we haven't written anything much about the stock here on The Motley Fool just yet -- so allow me to introduce you to it. Here's what you need to know.",
        "Image source: Getty Images.",
        "As our friends at StreetInsider.com kindly inform us, AMTD International is \"a subsidiary of AMTD Group, a premier Hong Kong-headquartered financial institution, Asia's No. 1 independent investment banking firm and the largest independent asset management firm in Asia for PRC regional banks and new economy companies.\" It's also the first home-grown Hong Kong financial institution and the first independent Asian investment banking firm to ever list on the New York Stock Exchange.",
        "Or put more simply, this is a Chinese bank.",
        "AMTD International went public on the NYSE on Aug. 5 at $8.91 per share, and was quickly off to the races, finishing the day up 13% at $10.09. Unfortunately, it has been mostly downhill from there. Over the three weeks that its underwriters have been bound by a quiet period to say nothing in support of the stock, AMTD International shares slumped 17% to close below their offer price last night.",
        "Six investment bankers (most of which you've probably never heard of before) teamed up to underwrite the IPO. Notably, these included both AMTD Global Markets (AMTD International's parent company) and Loop Capital Markets.",
        "It's this second analyst, Loop Capital, that initiated coverage of AMTD International with a buy rating this morning.",
        "So why does Loop Capital like AMTD International? Well, first and foremost, I suspect, because it underwrote the IPO -- natch. But as Loop Capital explains in today's note, covered on TheFly.com , it also likes AMTD International's \"deep roots to tycoon families\" in China, which is evolving into a big market for investment banking services.",
        "And Loop Capital hopes to see the bank itself evolve into a \"super-connector\" between capital and technology in this market, connecting new companies to the money that will fund their growth. Already, the analyst sees AMTD International \"rapidly growing\" in the market. Far from continuing to slide, Loop Capital believes the stock will soon turn around, resume growing, and hit $12 a share within a year.",
        "Do the numbers bear that out? Yes and no. (Or rather, at first glance no, but maybe yes.)",
        "According to S&P Global Market Intelligence data, AMTD International did a little less than $129 million in revenue in 2017. That revenue shrank nearly 30% in 2018 (albeit in the midst of a fierce trade war that's proved to be a drag on China's economy, let us not forget). Revenue is, however, bouncing back. Over the past 12 reported months, S&P Global puts AMTD International's total revenue at $153.5 million (up from 2017 levels). Assets under management are growing nicely as well, up from $1.1 billion at the end of 2016 to $2.3 billion at the end of last year.",
        "Net income for the last 12 months is an impressive $118.1 million, such that, with a market capitalization of $1.9 billion, AMTD International stock currently sells for only a little over 16 times earnings. That doesn't seem an unreasonable valuation to me, and with analysts currently forecasting that both sales and earnings will more than double by 2021 (against 2018 levels), growth currently doesn't seem to be something investors in AMTD International need to worry about.",
        "It may be too early in the game to call this stock a winner -- and I'd really like to see AMTD International get an earnings report or two under its belt before making any predictions -- but for now, I'd say the odds of Loop Capital being right on this one look pretty good.",

        "MARKET TUMULT",
        "The latest round of market tumult to plague Argentina started with the Aug. 11 primary election, in which business-friendly President Mauricio Macri got soundly thumped by center-left Peronist challenger Alberto Fernandez.",

        "A little clinical data can go a long way. Promising updates from two pipeline assets have catapulted shares of ArQule (NASDAQ: ARQL) 230% higher since the beginning of 2019. The company's market cap soared to $1.3 billion, which is pretty impressive considering it has rarely topped $400 million in the last decade.",
        "The clinical results announced to date need to be replicated in larger trials, but investors have reason to be at least a little excited for the company's future. Knowing that, what should investors make of the fact that shares of ArQule have tumbled 20% since the beginning of July? Is the stock a buy ?",
        "Image source: Getty Images.",
        "Investors can't be sure that ArQule will wrap up clinical trials with successful results in hand, but recent updates do help to validate the company's approach to treating diseases. The pipeline harbors four drug candidates that inhibit the activity of proteins called kinases. While the proteins drive a wide range of cellular processes in healthy organisms, kinases can also help cancer cells to proliferate or trigger the progression of various diseases when they become too active.",
        "ArQule is studying drug compounds that can selectively inhibit specific kinases while sparing others. For instance, ARQ 531 is being studied as a treatment for cancers affecting B cells, a type of white blood cell. The drug candidate binds to the BTK protein, which plays a crucial role in the creation of new B cells. While other BTK inhibitors exist, they're too good at binding to the protein, which often mutates its structure and results in the cancer becoming resistant to treatment.",
        "That's why ARQ 531 was designed to bind to the BTK protein reversibly (reducing the risk of mutations) and to a common mutated form (reducing the impact of mutations). If the hypothesis pans out, then the drug candidate might allow individuals to keep their cancer in check for longer periods of time.",
        "The results from a small study announced in June were promising. A daily dose of ARQ 531 achieved a partial response in four of six patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and one of eight patients with a rare complication of CLL called Richter's syndrome. All patients had been treated unsuccessfully with other drugs. One patient has been treated for two years, which suggests the reversible binding properties might be delivering the expected benefits.",
        "ArQule also announced promising results for ARQ 092 (miransertib) , an inhibitor of ATK proteins, in treating Proteus syndrome and other overgrowth diseases. The rare diseases are characterized by bones, skin, or organs growing out of proportion to the rest of the body because of overactive ATK proteins. Of the 17 individuals tested in a small study, nine had stable disease after one year of treatment and three had stable disease with less than one year of treatment. Eleven patients reported a reduction in pain. There are currently no approved ATK inhibitors or drugs for treating overgrowth disorders on the market.",
        "Image source: Getty Images.",
        "Following promising proof-of-concept results for ARQ 531, the next step is to study the drug candidate in a larger population of patients. ArQule is preparing to conduct a phase 2 trial for the asset with an additional 80 to 150 individuals, although the company has not announced a timeline for when the study might begin or have preliminary data available. The company is also planning to enroll the first patient in a registrational trial (a study that can support an initial application for marketing approval) for miransertib in Proteus syndrome and rare overgrowth disorders before the end of September. The trial will conclude once all patients in three separate cohorts have received treatment for 12 months, so likely in 2021 or 2022.",
        "ArQule also expects to report initial data from a phase 1b trial evaluating ARQ 751, a next-generation AKT inhibitor, before the end of 2019. The drug candidate is being studied as a potential treatment for cancers with solid tumors harboring specific genetic profiles, which the company believes are present in up to 5% of all solid tumors. The preliminary results will determine whether the drug candidate can move into midstage studies and if investors might have a third promising pipeline asset to watch.",
        "The fourth pipeline asset is derazantinib, although ArQule has licensed the rights and development responsibilities to Basilea (globally ex-China) and Sinovant (China). If the treatment earns regulatory approval and reaches certain sales milestones, then ArQule could earn up to $400 million in milestone payments. However, most analysts aren't that optimistic for the asset, and those who are don't see major sales until the 2030s, so it shouldn't figure into the near-term future of the company.",
        "ArQule exited June with $179 million in cash, which the company says should be able to fund operating expenses into 2022. That goes a long way to de-risking the stock. Meanwhile, ArQule has a promising duo of pipeline assets headlined by ARQ 531, which will soon progress into a much larger phase 2 trial.",
        "ArQule is clearly headed in the right direction and may prove successful in targeting overactive kinases to treat disease. That said, while the preliminary results do look promising, the safety and efficacy of ARQ 531 must be replicated in a more robust setting -- such as the planned phase 2 trial -- before investors get too carried away. At a market cap of $1.1 billion, this stock isn't a screaming buy, but investors with an existing position have no reason to sell, either.",

        "Operator",
        "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to today's Second Quarter 2019 Frontline Limited Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today on 27th of August 2019.",
        "I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Robert MacLeod. Please go ahead, sir.",
        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "Thank you very much, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you very much for dialing in to what is Frontline's second quarter earnings call . There are very exciting market dynamics in play now, as the market looks to -- look set to improve further from the recent recovery. Last week, we announced the purchase of 10 Suezmaxes, and we hold options for a further four. We do this at a time we believe is ideal, more on that very shortly. This call will conclude by taking questions. Let's get started and look at the Company highlights for the quarter.",
        "Net income was $1.1 million. Adjusted for non-cash items, we made $4.2 million in the quarter. For the VLCCs, the spot TCE was $25,600. Q3 bookings show 83% of the days booked at $28,000. This number will likely decrease, as stated in the [Phonetic] press release due to accounting treatments of voyage charters.",
        "Suezmaxes came in at $16,200 and 70% of Q3 is done at $18,300 [Phonetic]. On the Aframaxes or LR2s, low $18,000 in Q2 and similar guiding for 68% of Q3. We recently obtained financing commitment at very attractive terms on our 2020 Suezmax delivery in May. And we have been continuously able to secure attractive financing.",
        "Let's look at the right side of the slide and the Trafigura-Suezmax deal. As I will discuss later, we have a very constructive view on the market. And we believe we are right at the start of a market upturn that could be the start of a strong tanker cycle. This view gave us the conviction to acquire 10 too fast and '19 built Suezmaxes, all of which are fitted with scrubbers from Trafigura. Five vessels will be chartered back to Trafigura for three years at $28,400 with a profit-sharing scheme, where we will receive 50% of all profits.",
        "We find this to be a very attractive value deal and it also protects our downside. Importantly, we don't have to wait for the acquisition to close to get access to the vessel earnings. We will take the ships on time charter within the next few weeks or month, and five vessels will immediately be time chartered back to Trafigura. We are very pleased with Trafigura becoming a strategic shell of Frontline. And we see potential synergies going forward, given their significant presence in the global oil trading markets.",
        "We've also, which is independently from this deal, formed a joint venture with Trafigura to establish a global supplier of marine fuels. We believe we are exceptionally well positioned ahead of IMO 2020, through this joint venture and other steps already taken by the Company, including our investments in scrubber manufacturer, FMSI.",
        "IMO 2020 looks to us to be the biggest event in the shipping market and the tanker trade for decades, and we believe it will play out very positively for our shareholders.",
        "With that, I'll hand the call over to Inger to take us through the financials in detail please.",
        "Inger M. Klemp -- Chief Financial Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "Thanks, Robert, and good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let's turn to Slide 4 and 5, and look at the financial highlights and the income statement.",
        "Frontline achieved total operating revenues, net of voyage expenses, of $103 million and EBITDA adjusted for certain non-cash items of $56 million in the second quarter. Frontline reported net income of $1.1 million, equivalent to $0.01 per share, and a net income adjusted for certain non-cash items of $4.2 million, equivalent to $0.02 per share in the second quarter. The non-cash items this quarter consisted of $1.7 million unrealized gain on marketable securities, a $0.8 million in share of results of associated company and $5.6 million loss on derivatives.",
        "The second quarter shows a decrease of $40.7 million against adjusted EBITDA of $96 million, and a decrease of $41.1 million against adjusted net income of $45.5 million in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in net income in the second quarter is mainly explained by a decrease in result on a time charter basis, due to the lower reported TCE rates in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.",
        "Let's then take a look at the balance sheet on Slide 6. The changes to the balance sheet as of June 30 compared to March 31st, 2019, mainly relates to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $5 million, which is the net effect of capex payments to the payment of debt, draw down on debt, cash from operations and the proceeds from issuance of shares under the ATM program in the quarter. An increase in vessels of $70 million is due to the delivery of Front Discovery in April and depreciation in the quarter. A decrease in vessels under finance leases by $3 million due to depreciation, net increase in debt with $31 million in the quarter, following $59 million in repayments and $89.5 million in draw downs.",
        "A decrease in obligations on the finance leases with $3.3 million, due to amortization of profit share expense and lease repayments. And finally, an increase in equity of $10.5 million, representing the net income in the second quarter and $9.3 million of share issuance proceeds in relation to the ATM program.",
        "As of June 30, Frontline had $257 million in cash and cash equivalents, including the undrawn amount under our unsecured loan facility, marketable securities and minimum cash requirements. Our remaining newbuilding CapEx requirements amounted to $225 million related to one Suezmax tanker and one VLCC which are both expected to be delivered in May 2020, and two LR2 tankers which are expected to be delivered in January and March 2021.",
        "We estimate approximately $164 million in debt capacity for these new buildings. We have no near-term debt maturities. The first debt maturity is in November 2020, when our senior unsecured loan facility to $275 million matures. We had drawn down $120 million under this facility, and $155 million remains available and undrawn as June 30, 2019.",
        "Then, let's take a closer look at cash breakeven rate and cash generation potential on Slide 7. We estimate average cash cost breakeven rate for the remainder of 2019 of approximately $24,500 per day for the VLCCs, $21,300 per day for Suezmax tankers and $16,200 per day for the LR2 tankers. These rates are the all-in daily rates that our vessels must earn to cover budgeted operating costs and dry dock, estimated interest expenses, TC and bareboat hires, installments on loans and G&A expenses.",
        "We had included dry dock costs for four VLCCs, four Suezmax tankers and one LR2 tanker in the second half of 2019. Frontline's low cash breakeven rates offers a strong downside protection against low rate and at the same time, it creates a great upside potential in the strengthening tanker market.",
        "Every $1,000 per day in achieved rates in excess of our cash breakeven, translates to approximately $22 million in incremental net income per year or $0.12 per share, which shows the net -- the high importance of remaining -- maintaining our low cash breakeven rates.",
        "In the graph on the right-hand side of the slide, we have shown incremental net income per year and per share, assuming $10,000, $20,000 and $30,000 per day in achieved rates in excess of our cash breakeven, respectively. The operating expenses per day in the first quarter of 2019 were $10,500 for VLCC, $7,500 for the Suezmax tankers and $7,100 for the LR2 tankers. We did dry docked 2 VLCCs in the second quarter, and four VLCCs and one Suezmax tanker are scheduled for dry dock in the third quarter of 2019.",
        "And with this, I leave the word to Robert again.",
        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "Thank you so much. So let's look at the key market developments. We are once again seeing the market behave in a counter-seasonal manner this year, as we also saw in the first quarter when U.S. exports began to surge. In Q2, we witnessed the largest decline in global refinery throughputs seen this decade, due to extended maintenance ahead of IMO 2020. Looking back, I would actually say that rates kept up pretty well, given what was going on with the refineries.",
        "Recently VLCC rates have again moved up sharply, refineries are now restoring capacity and throughput looks to be rebounding quickly. Crude oil demand growth is forecasted to be stronger for the balance of the year, after softening through the first half.",
        "For the balance of 2019, we expect the tanker market to remain volatile, due to crude oil supply concerns and geopolitical tensions, that continue to trend higher. Importantly, U.S. crude oil production is growing year-over-year, while OPEC production is declining following production cuts. This is leading to increased exports from the Atlantic, which we expect to continue. This expectation is supported by both increasing U.S. production and export capacity, which has been coming online steadily. A large portion of incremental production is flowing to Asia, supporting strong growth in tonne-mile demand.",
        "Next slide, please. We'll have a look at how deliveries decline after 2019 and older vessels will face costs. The growth of the crude oil tanker fleet is a key factor for our markets. So far in 2019, 41 VLCCs have been added to the global fleet, compared to three vessel demolitions. An additional 33 VLCCs are scheduled to be delivered in 2019, with 43 more to follow in 2020, before the order book declines sharply.",
        "Despite continued deliveries of newbuilding vessels in the short term, effective crude tanker capacity growth is expected to slow as vessels are taken out of service, regular dockings, scrubber or ballast water installation and other preparations for the IMO 2020 regulations. While the pace of recycling has slowed significantly compared to last year, there are still 170 VLCCs that are greater than 15 years of age, and we believe a large number of all the vessels will be taken out of the market and either be recycled or go on floating storage as part of a regulation-driven phasing out of all the vessels.",
        "Let's move to the summary slide, please. There are obviously various factors to support our positive market outlook, and we constantly monitor developments. In the short-term, we have already seen the market rebound, following extended refinery maintenance ahead of IMO 2020. Although, global demand growth is forecasted to slow down, the pace of growth remains a positive. The fact that incremental production is coming from the U.S. and a good deal of it is heading east is a clear positive for tonne-mile demand growth. Replacing barrels from the Middle East with barrels from the Atlantic is widely viewed as positive for tanker markets, given the increase in distance travels.",
        "Finally, the vessel's supply picture looks very positive, after new vessel deliveries have put pressure on our market for the last two years. As we just looked at, there is still a fair amount of vessels to be delivered over the next 18 months, but this number has eclipsed by the number of vessels created in 15 years. And we should also see some effective reduction in capacity as vessels are temporarily taken out of the trading markets. On the other hand, the risk of a global slowdown in GDP growth is dominating the news headlines and a real risk that has added volatility to the equity markets.",
        "Finally, there's always the chance that IMO 2020 implementation will not proceed as expected. And although we believe in fuel spreads to widen as we approach 2020, it could, of course, narrow and diminish scrubber economics.",
        "To conclude, we expect the market to remain volatile, but continue to trade higher. Crude oil tanker demand will continue to receive a significant boost as crude demand increases in the second half of this year. Although there are always risks related to slowing global demand, multiple possible market drivers should result in a strong tanker earnings for the balance of the year, and we expect this strength to kick off 2020 positively for us. We believe Frontline is well positioned going forward, now with even greater earnings potential.",
        "With that, I would like to turn over to questions, please.",
        "Operator",
        "Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Randy Giveans from Jefferies. Please ask your question.",
        "Randy Giveans -- Jefferies -- Analyst",
        "How's it going? How are you all doing this morning?",
        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "Good. Thanks, Randy.",
        "Randy Giveans -- Jefferies -- Analyst",
        "Excellent. All right, so looking at your fleet, in recent months, you ordered two newbuildings, acquired some resales, most recently bought those 10 Suezmaxes from Trafigura. So how are we thinking about kind of further fleet growth from here? Are you pretty satisfied with the fleet following this most recent large acquisition?",
        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "I think looking at the fleets overall, let's say, over the last three, four years, we've transformed from our returns of average age, we've really brought it down. We've had a lot of ships delivered. We sold off a lot of the old ships. So I think, the process here, has been very positive for the Company. We've been looking actively at growth for periods here, and we have to say, we've done resales. And last week, we did a Trafigura deal. We -- overall, as you look at our fleets, we've had product exposure through the LR2s for some time, which in terms of size, we're pretty happy with.",
        "We'd like the other preference, we'd like the crude segment in terms of growth. We found that growth on Suezmaxes. But I think it's fair to say the way our fleet is structured now than in terms of future growth, then VLCCs will have our special attention.",
        "Randy Giveans -- Jefferies -- Analyst",
        "Sure. That makes sense. And then looking at your investment in the joint venture with Trafigura, was there a monetary cost to this to acquire your present ownership? And also, will there be financial risk from either profitable or unprofitable bunkering trading? Or is it solely kind of an operational play for your fuel requirements?",
        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "[Indecipherable] with this, we will put a small amount of working capital into it, and that's it. So there's no investments as such. And in terms of the risk profile, we will be very conservative, so we capitalize.",
        "Randy Giveans -- Jefferies -- Analyst",
        "All right. And then, I guess, last quick question. Do you have an updated kind of cadence for offhire days and kind of capex spend on the scrubber installations? Like how many scrubbers do you expect to have by January 2020 in the next three or four months here?",
        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "So we've been -- so the simple numbers have been that about one-third of our fleet will have them installed by Q1. Given the Trafigura deal, we're fast forwarding the amount with that deal. So by Q1 next year, we'll be just below half the fleet.",
        "Randy Giveans -- Jefferies -- Analyst",
        "Q1 half fleet. Excellent. Hey, thank you so much for the color and congrats on all the deals.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell from Evercore. Please ask your question.",
        "Jon Chappell -- Evercore -- Analyst",
        "Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Robert, to follow up on the other question in the fleet. So you've obviously made a pretty big transaction. You talked about maybe focusing on the VLCCs going forward. At what point do you feel that you're in kind of harvest mode? And you're done spending, you already have a fleet that's under four years of age, and you kind of transition to the Frontline [Indecipherable], where capital return takes priority over continuing to build the size of the fleet.",
        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "Now we -- in terms o f earnings power now, or seeing a [Indecipherable] through the slide, where we have -- we are substantial. So I think the focus now will be to possibly do something on the VLCCs, we certainly don't have to. If this market takes off as we expect, then we have grea t earnings potential as it is. But as for our strategy coming into this, then we keep -- we paid now spot for quite some time, because we've had a belief that we will see a strengthening market coming into 2020. So hopefully this plays out and then we will take opportunities there, like we did when doing the Trafigura deal to lock in some charters and we will do some of that and have a conservative approach to the cycle.",
        "Jon Chappell -- Evercore -- Analyst",
        "And I know it's not kind of the legacy MO of Frontline to delever, but after this Trafigura deal, looks like about 80% leverage, if we take the high end of the cost range, just for this deal alone, which brings Frontline back above 60%. So how do you think about using cash flow from operations, if the cycle plays out, as you and I both expect to delever the balance sheet a little bit, as opposed to maybe jacking up the dividend?",
        "Inger M. Klemp -- Chief Financial Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "I guess this is something that the Board will have to discuss going forward, how we are going to approach that. But according to our dividend strategy, that remains unchanged anyway. And that says, as you know, that the excess cash flow from the Company should be used in more or less for dividends going forward.",
        "Jon Chappell -- Evercore -- Analyst",
        "Okay. The last one, Robert, it's kind of fresh, so I don't know if you've had a chance to assess it yet. But the addition of crude oil to China's retaliatory tariff list, you mentioned, yourself the importance of the Atlantic in the long haul trade and we're at the belief that that's what's really been supporting the market in the phase of these OPEC cuts. Have you assessed either operationally, what it potentially means for your fleet, or financially from a supply demand perspective? If these tariffs were to be enacted and the U.S. became uneconomic -- U.S. crude became uneconomic in China, what that -- what might that do to your outlook on the tanker markets?",
        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "No. I think it's an excellent question, but on this call, and I'll refrain to conclude much.",
        "Jon Chappell -- Evercore -- Analyst",
        "Okay, thanks, Robert. Thanks, Inger.",
        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "Thanks.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. The next question comes from line of Gregory Lewis from BTIG. Please ask your question.",
        "Gregory Lewis -- BTIG -- Analyst",
        "Yes. Thank you, and good afternoon. Robert, I guess, thanks for providing the kind of guidance for Q3, but I guess at this point, we are almost in September. Just kind of curious, we've seen a nice run up in VLCC rates over the last couple of weeks. Do we have any kind of visibility at this point into what Q4 bookings already look like? Have we started to get anything on the books for Q4?",
        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "No. For the Q4, we've done a little bit, but very little. We're seeing in sales, we'll see in the last few weeks. There's a lot of momentum in the market. The Vs have moved, the Suezmaxes are on the move. So I think the -- to look at the quarters, I'd say that Q3, have to say, we've already booked a lot when the market started turning, I think we should look at Q3 as being not a great quarter, we have -- you see in the guidance, right? But the good thing is that we're starting to move market moves so that the Q4 bookings days started at low percentage, where we're seeing the high numbers. So hopefully we've teed off it to get a really good Q4, but the next month will show.",
        "Gregory Lewis -- BTIG -- Analyst",
        "Okay. And then with it Trafigura acquisition, I guess, congratulations on that. That Suezmax guidance that you gave on that slide, does that include that -- those vessels? Or was that more like the end of the Q2, so prior to the acquisition of those vessels?",
        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "So that -- [Indecipherable] -- that's excluding those.",
        "Gregory Lewis -- BTIG -- Analyst",
        "Okay. So that's excluding those. Okay, great. And then just one more for me. I guess as we look at the decision to go into the Suezmaxes, it seems like over the last couple of years there's, you've even mentioned it yourself, the order book for the Suezmax has come down. Strategically, like how should we think about Suezmaxes in the crude market now? Jonathan mentioned, clearly, there's been a lot of oil moving from the U.S. to Asia. That's not [Indecipherable] Suez trade, just kind of, how you're thinking about the Suez market given that you just made a pretty substantial acquisition into the space?",
        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "We like the Suezmax segment. We already had 18 ships in the segment, all modern. And the thing about the Suezmax, you can triangulate them. So if you look at our earnings, when these -- the VLCCs are down into low teens, for example, then normally the Suezmaxes trade just above and that's due to the triangulation. And they're doing a lot of West Africa. They're also doing lot of the Atlantic [Indecipherable]. So they're doing some long-haul trades, also short, so this is a very flexible and versatile ship unit, which also with the ratios we have in the market, it's a very good segment for us. So I think in terms of commercial performance, over the last four, five quarters, then Suezmax [Technical Issues] is probably our strongest.",
        "Jon Chappell -- Evercore -- Analyst",
        "Okay, perfect. Thank you for taking my questions. Have a great day.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Robert Silveira from IE Silveira [Phonetic]. Please ask your question.",
        "Yes. Hello, Robert, thank you for doing a good job. How do you see the horizon as far as coming back to a dividend? First quarter of 2020, second quarter, could you give us some color on when that might occur?",
        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "I think, the -- this as well as Inger said in other question, I think it would be down to the Board. But the way I see this is that we're coming into positive territory and in terms of facility payable to Mr. Fredriksen, we've drawn now $120 million and the overall Company is looking good. And I would always say, it's always fair to say, that we will return to paying ou t dividends sooner rather than later.",
        "Operator",
        "All right. Thank you. Could you give us some color on what's going on these days in the Strait of Hormuz where you had problems in the past? Do you see it coming down or is it still very tenuous?",
        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "We are very much on the alert still.",
        "Operator",
        "Alert? Okay. Is it affecting your bookings from that area? Some companies have actually decided to stay away. You have not decided to do that, right?",
        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "No, we've not decided to stay away with -- so we are doing business there, but we have chosen other trades due to the situation. So also the Frontline trade was a very, very crucial situation and we've gone down in terms of bookings. But we are still trading in the area, but with heightened security and we will be keeping a very close eye on everything that's going on.",
        "Operator",
        "Okay, good. Could you give me a little color on how you see Brazilian production and how that may balance, for instance, what's going on in the United States with tariffs with China, etc. etc.? Will it change things very much and how is Brazil coming as far as paying out...",
        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "It's one of them [Phonetic] earlier question, it is a difficult one to be very precise and conclusive on, but if you look at the expiration and the plants in the country and the investors being brought in, also from our state in which a company that we know, then I think it's fair to say that it looks like it's going to be a growth area in terms of exports.",
        "Operator",
        "Okay. Well, that's it for me. Thank you very much for taking my questions.",

        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "So the first one was delivered, so back to the deal, we take exposure on these ships as soon as we can. So the first one actually delivered at the time of signing and then we're about to take delivery of the second one. And so they don't call at the same time, the delivery is connected to calling various ports, but certainly I think we should be -- we should have all the ships within September.",
        "Lukas Daul -- ABG -- Analyst",
        "Okay. Within September. Good. And then on -- you sort of mentioned in the press release, when you announced that looking at different options, how to finance it? Could you sort of share of bit of light on that? What would be the ideal financing structure?",
        "Robert Hvide Macleod -- Director and Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS",
        "We're not going into be [Indecipherable] on what we will clearly focus. We have various options now. What we can say is that, assume this deal was ultimately [Technical Issues] pre-checking. The finance is definitely available to Frontline and it is at very, very attractive terms. We will aim to conclude finance as soon as we can. We will then lower the cost that we are currently paying. So it's a top priority for us to close the production and do the finance as in.",

      "text": [
        " Stocks opened higher Friday only to see all three major U.S. indexes slip into the red by mid-morning. No matter how stocks eventually close on the last trading day of the month, August marked a volatile period for U.S. markets as trade war fears mount amid broader global economic uncertainty. The S&P 500 is on track to close August down roughly 1.5%, which would represent its worst month since May. Despite macroeconomic worries and growing recession speculation, U.S. consumers don't seem afraid just yet. On Friday, the Commerce Department said that U.S. personal-consumption expenditures popped a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in July from June, which marked a jump from the previous two months. Furthermore, U.S. third-quarter GDP estimates remain relatively strong at 2.3%. This would represent a jump from Q2's 2% expansion, but down from 2018's 2.9% total growth. Despite the positive signs in the U.S., Germany, Japan, and other economic powers have government debt with negative interest rates. And of course the trade war between the U.S. and China could still drag the world's two largest economies down. Both President Trump and Chinese officials have seeming taken a more optimistic tone recently. But the specter of the ongoing trade dispute is likely to linger, especially with the new round of tariffs set to start on September 1. Obviously big news in either direction could happen at any moment. For now, however, markets have likely priced in most of the current fears. Furthermore, investors and Wall Street still need somewhere to put their money, which is why yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, often considered the world's safest asset, have fallen over the last few months as investors pour in. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rested at 1.51% through morning trading Friday, down from just over 2% at the end of July. Therefore a phenomenon known as the Tina effect or \"there is no alternative\" to stocks remains in play. With U.S. yields so low and many major global rates in the negative, investors should look for strong companies that pay a dividend. We found a few that inventors might want to consider buying, utilizing our Zacks Stock Screener  \u2026  Apple   AAPL   Apple is an obvious pick here. The iPhone powerhouse has expanded beyond hardware in recent years. Tim Cook's company has grown its services business and it is set to launch its streaming TV offering, Apple TV+, this fall in the hopes that it will be able to compete alongside Netflix NFLX  , Amazon Prime AMZN  , and others. Apple is projected to see its current quarter (Q4) and full-year fiscal 2019 earnings and revenue slip on slower iPhone and Chinese sales. Peeking ahead though, our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for Apple's Q1 revenue and EPS to jump on its way to a larger 2020 comeback. Perhaps more importantly, AAPL currently pays an annualized dividend of $3.08 per share, with a 1.50% yield. This roughly matches the 10-year U.S. Treasury note at the moment. Apple also consistently ups its dividend payout and buys back billions of dollars worth of stock with its over $200 billion of cash on hand. Apple is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports an \"A\" grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system. AAPL stock seems like as safe of play as a U.S. treasury at this moment, that also provides the possibility of some more serious returns down the road as there is nothing stopping the tech titan from rolling out another game-changing product to bolster its already lucrative portfolio.  Coca-Cola Company   KO   Coca-Cola beat quarterly estimates this past quarter and upped its full-year organic revenue growth forecast. KO shares have soared 25% over the last 12 months-which crushes the S&P 500's slight downturn-and currently rest right at their 52-week and all-time highs. Coca-Cola's strong run comes as the beverage giant continues to successfully expands beyond its soft drinks. This includes the roll out its first-ever Costa Coffee ready-to-drink product in Great Britain after KO purchased the British coffee chain for $5.1 billion earlier this year. The company has also made investments in Gatorade PEP  rival BodyArmor, introduced its first energy drink under the Coca-Cola brand, and much more. Coca-Cola's longer-term positive earnings revision activity helps KO earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. KO also rocks a \"B\" grade for Growth and is projected to see both its 2020 revenue and earnings climbed well above its current-year estimates, which are also expected to pop. Lastly, Coca-Cola's annualized dividend sits at $1.60 per share, for a 2.91% yield right now. KO's hu ge dividend yield  alone makes it look highly attractive in our current rate environment.  Microsoft   MSFT   MSFT is the world's most valuable public company and has outperformed most of the so-called FAANG stocks over the last several years. The historic tech firm's current annualized dividend of $1.84 is up roughly 10% from the year-ago period and 18% on a two-year stack. MSFT's yield is currently the lowest out of this group at 1.33%. Yet, Microsoft's 41% climb in 2019 has pushed down its dividend yield. And this growth, along with the potential for more, more than offsets the slightly lower yield. Microsoft is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The firm is also projected to see its fiscal 2020 and 2021 revenue surge 11% and 10.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, MSFT's EPS figures are projected to climb 10% in its current fiscal year and 12.8% above that estimate in the following year. Investors should note that along with Microsoft's growing cloud computing business, highlighted by Azure, its Office, Windows, and hardware units have continued to evolve and shine. Lastly, Microsoft has managed to stay mostly out of the U.S. government's sights at a time when Google GOOGL  , Facebook FB  , and others could face somewhat serious intervention. \u00a0  Today's Best Stocks from Zacks   makeArticleAd();  Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies?

        "Stocks opened higher Friday only to see all three major U.S. indexes slip into the red by mid-morning. No matter how stocks eventually close on the last trading day of the month, August marked a volatile period for U.S. markets as trade war fears mount amid broader global economic uncertainty.",
        "The S&P 500 is on track to close August down roughly 1.5%, which would represent its worst month since May. Despite macroeconomic worries and growing recession speculation, U.S. consumers don't seem afraid just yet.",
        "On Friday, the Commerce Department said that U.S. personal-consumption expenditures popped a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in July from June, which marked a jump from the previous two months. Furthermore, U.S. third-quarter GDP estimates remain relatively strong at 2.3%. This would represent a jump from Q2's 2% expansion, but down from 2018's 2.9% total growth.",
        "Despite the positive signs in the U.S., Germany, Japan, and other economic powers have government debt with negative interest rates. And of course the trade war between the U.S. and China could still drag the world's two largest economies down.",
        "Both President Trump and Chinese officials have seeming taken a more optimistic tone recently. But the specter of the ongoing trade dispute is likely to linger, especially with the new round of tariffs set to start on September 1.",
        "Obviously big news in either direction could happen at any moment. For now, however, markets have likely priced in most of the current fears. Furthermore, investors and Wall Street still need somewhere to put their money, which is why yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, often considered the world's safest asset, have fallen over the last few months as investors pour in.",
        "Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rested at 1.51% through morning trading Friday, down from just over 2% at the end of July. Therefore a phenomenon known as the Tina effect or \"there is no alternative\" to stocks remains in play.",
        "With U.S. yields so low and many major global rates in the negative, investors should look for strong companies that pay a dividend. We found a few that inventors might want to consider buying, utilizing our Zacks Stock Screener  \u2026",
        " Apple   AAPL  ",
        "Apple is an obvious pick here. The iPhone powerhouse has expanded beyond hardware in recent years. Tim Cook's company has grown its services business and it is set to launch its streaming TV offering, Apple TV+, this fall in the hopes that it will be able to compete alongside Netflix NFLX  , Amazon Prime AMZN  , and others. Apple is projected to see its current quarter (Q4) and full-year fiscal 2019 earnings and revenue slip on slower iPhone and Chinese sales. Peeking ahead though, our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for Apple's Q1 revenue and EPS to jump on its way to a larger 2020 comeback.",
        "Perhaps more importantly, AAPL currently pays an annualized dividend of $3.08 per share, with a 1.50% yield. This roughly matches the 10-year U.S. Treasury note at the moment. Apple also consistently ups its dividend payout and buys back billions of dollars worth of stock with its over $200 billion of cash on hand. Apple is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports an \"A\" grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system. AAPL stock seems like as safe of play as a U.S. treasury at this moment, that also provides the possibility of some more serious returns down the road as there is nothing stopping the tech titan from rolling out another game-changing product to bolster its already lucrative portfolio.",
        " Coca-Cola Company   KO  ",
        "Coca-Cola beat quarterly estimates this past quarter and upped its full-year organic revenue growth forecast. KO shares have soared 25% over the last 12 months-which crushes the S&P 500's slight downturn-and currently rest right at their 52-week and all-time highs. Coca-Cola's strong run comes as the beverage giant continues to successfully expands beyond its soft drinks. This includes the roll out its first-ever Costa Coffee ready-to-drink product in Great Britain after KO purchased the British coffee chain for $5.1 billion earlier this year. The company has also made investments in Gatorade PEP  rival BodyArmor, introduced its first energy drink under the Coca-Cola brand, and much more.",
        "Coca-Cola's longer-term positive earnings revision activity helps KO earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. KO also rocks a \"B\" grade for Growth and is projected to see both its 2020 revenue and earnings climbed well above its current-year estimates, which are also expected to pop. Lastly, Coca-Cola's annualized dividend sits at $1.60 per share, for a 2.91% yield right now. KO's hu ge dividend yield  alone makes it look highly attractive in our current rate environment.",

        "By David Shepardson",
        "WASHINGTON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc'sGoogle  will spend up to $200 million to settle a Federal Trade Commission investigation into YouTube's alleged violation of a children's privacy law, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.",
        "Politico reported the settlement is expected to be between $150 million and $200 million. The settlement is set to be announced next week and will be the largest ever fine imposed for violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule by collecting personal information from kids without parental consent.",
        "The FTC voted 3-2 to approve the settlement and sent it to the Justice Department as part of the review process, Reuters confirmed, citing a person familiar with the matter. The Washington Post reported the settlement's approval in July but did not detail the amount of the civil penalty.",
        "The settlement will far surpass the previous record set in February, a $5.7 million civil penalty imposed on Musical.ly, which did not ask for users' ages for three years. The online library for Musical.ly - now known as TikTok - features music popular with kids.",
        "Senator Ed Markey, a Democrat, said Friday \"the FTC appears to have let YouTube off the hook with a nominal fine for violating users' privacy online. And in this case, Google's intrusions on kids' personal info are at issue. We must come down hard on companies that infringe on children's privacy.\"",
        "On Thursday, Google launched YouTubeKids. The company said it built the site \"to create a safer environment for kids to explore their interests and curiosity, while giving parents the tools to customize the experience for their kids.\"",
        "Parents can select from three different age groups to choose age-appropriate content - preschool, ages 5-7 and 8-12.",
        "Katharina Kopp, deputy director of the Center for Digital Democracy, said Friday \"a settlement amount of $150-200 million would be woefully low, considering the egregious nature of the violation, how much Google profited from violating the law, and given Google's size and revenue.\"",
        "She added the fine \"would effectively reward Google for engaging in massive and illegal data collection.\" ",
        "In April 2018, the center, joined by other groups, filed an FTC complaint alleging YouTube profited from kids \"without first providing direct notice to parents and obtaining their consent as required by law. Google uses this information to target advertisements to children across the internet and across devices.\""

      "text": [
        "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips",
        "Hexo (NYSE: HEXO ) stock has traded sideways this month. Shares rose from $3.98 on July 29 to as high as $4.95 on Aug. 13. But since mid-August, shares have fallen back, closing at $3.94 per share on Aug. 29. Compared to its larger peers, shares have held steady.",
        "Shares in Canopy Growth (NYSE: CGC ) are down more than 28% for the month. Aurora Cannabis (NYSE: ACB ) stock has fallen roughly 12.7% since late July. Hexo is becoming increasingly focused on \"smoke free\" uses (beverages, edibles, etc.) than its peers. Focusing on this niche could be its key to success.",
        "With infused beverages hitting the market later this year , should investors take a position in HEXO ahead of this product launch? Or should investors take heed, given shares continue to trade at a high valuation? Let's take a closer look at Hexo stock.",
        "As I discussed in my prior article , expectations for cannabis-infused products drive the Hexo stock price. The company has partnered with Molson Coors (NYSE: TAP ) to launch Truss. Truss is Hexo's line of non-alcoholic, cannabis-infused beverages. This strategic partnership gives the company a greater chance of success in this space. With Molson Coors's scale and infrastructure,\u00a0Truss can be rolled out more efficiently.",
        "Another positive of this partnership is the structure. So far, strategic partnership deals have been highly dilutive to cannabis company investors. With Canopy Growth, Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ ) has quietly taken over the company . This also happened with Cronos (NASDAQ: CRON ) and its partner Altria \u00a0(NYSE: MO ).",
        "Molson Coors received warrants as part of the deal, but the partnership is structured as a joint venture. Molson Coors owns 57.5% , with Hexo owning the remainder. This may limit upside if infused beverages are a success. But it limits Molson Coors's control over the entire company. Molson Coors's warrants only give it the right to buy 11.5 million shares at a strike price of $6 a share . With 256.9 million shares outstanding, and 50.9 million warrants outstanding, this hardly gives Molson Coors control over Hexo's destiny.",
        "Other catalysts could move the Hexo stock price. The company's strategy focuses on \"smoke-free\" cannabis products. This includes edibles, vapes, wellness products, and cosmetics. Selling plain old pot is a commodity business. The opportunity to develop high-margin brands is the key to long-term profitability.",
        "Hexo is no slouch when it comes to selling pot. The company remains Quebec's biggest supplier . The recent acquisition of Newstrike Brands helps scale up their cultivation infrastructure. But is all of this reflected in the Hexo stock price? Let's take a look at how the stock's valuation stacks up to peers.",
        "Using the Enterprise Value/Sales (EV/Sales) ratio, the company trades in line with peers. The company's current EV/Sales ratio\u00a0 is 36.4. Compare this to Aurora Cannabis (EV/Sales of 45.6), Canopy Growth (EV/Sales of 35.3), and Cronos (EV/Sales of 98.5). An EV/Sales ratio of over 30 is still a rich valuation.",
        "The expectations of Truss and other products inflates the Hexo stock price. Investor enthusiasm has tapered off, as seen from the 53% drop from its all-time high in April. If Truss is a success, Hexo stock should see a massive boost. But with the current rich valuation, additional declines are a risk. If investors lose faith in Hexo shares could fall much further.",
        "So what does this mean for investors entering the stock today? Cannabis shares have been beaten down. But marijuana stocks have yet to trade at fire sale prices. It's impossible to predict the unpredictable. Only time will tell if we have reached a bottom in cannabis stock valuation. But long term, investors may be getting a bargain entering Hexo stock at the current trading price.",
        "Hexo stock offers a unique opportunity for cannabis investors. While its competitors try to dominate the smoked marijuana space, Hexo is going \"smoke-free.\" Focusing on beverages, edibles, and other cannabis-infused products, the company could find riches in niches. Their partnership with Molson Coors is a conservative way to get scale without sacrificing much equity. Unlike its larger peers, Molson Coors is in no position to quietly take over the company.",
        "The Hexo stock price remains inflated. Investors are betting on the company's future potential. Long-term, shares could see big gains. Short-term volatility is a risk. Keep HEXO on your radar, but tread carefully before entering a position.",
        "As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.",
        "The post Hexo's \"Smoke-Free\" Strategy Is Solid, but Shares Remain Overvalued appeared first on InvestorPlace .",

        "Operator",
        "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Big Lots' Second Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] A brief question-and-answer portion will follow the prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]",
        "At this time, I would like to introduce today's first speaker, Andy Regrut, Vice President of Investor Relations.",
        "Andrew D. Regrut -- Vice President, Investor Relations",
        "Good morning. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter conference call. With me here today in Columbus are Bruce Thorn, our President and CEO; Lisa Bachmann, Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Operating Officer; and Jonathan Ramsden, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer.",
        "Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements we make on today's call involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to our safe harbor provisions, as stated in our press release and our SEC filings, and that actual results can differ materially from those described in our forward-looking statements.",
        "All commentary today is focused on adjusted non-GAAP results. For the second quarter of fiscal 2019, this excludes after tax charges totaling $14.5 million or $0.37 per diluted share associated with the implementation of our strategic business transformation. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP adjusted earnings are available in today's press release.",
        "This morning, Bruce, will start the call with a few opening comments. Lisa will discuss Q2 results from a merchandising perspective. Jonathan will review the financial highlights from the quarter and the outlook for fiscal 2019, and Bruce will complete our prepared remarks before taking your questions.",
        "I'll now turn the call over to Bruce.",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I would like to take a moment to welcome Jonathan to the Big Lots family. He brings extensive and highly relevant experience to the role, and we're excited to have a leader with his breadth of knowledge as we transform and reposition our business for long-term success. I also want to extend my sincere gratitude and appreciation to Tim Johnson for his numerous contributions over 18 plus years with Big Lots. T.J. helped oversee the growth and professionalization of our finance function while also leading our real estate and asset protection teams. In addition, T.J. was instrumental in developing and fostering the Company's relationship with Nationwide Children's Hospital. We wish him the best as he embarks on a new chapter.",
        "Turning back to our business, we'll talk more about the second quarter in near-term outlook in a moment. But before doing that, I want to take a few moments to review where we are on the transformational journey that we refer to as Operation North Star. While elements of this plan, such as the Store of the Future, have been in progress for some time, the last six to nine months have involved a tremendous effort across the entire organization to chart a new course for the Company. This effort has been supported by a world class consulting firm and began with extensive customer research to establish where we should play and how we can win. Since then, the transformation project has evolved into approximately 20 detailed work streams, under three overarching themes of driving growth, funding the journey and enabling our organization to deliver on these opportunities.",
        "As we sit here today, I'm excited and highly encouraged by the progress we've made on these initiatives. Most importantly, I am confident that we are poised to see an acceleration of the impact on our business as we move into 2020 and beyond. This confidence is based on the results and validation we have already seen. Under driving growth, this includes the continued rollout our Store of the Future, but also many other initiatives to drive top line growth. These include accelerating our new store openings, a step change in volume, we are driving through our developing e-com and omni-channel capabilities. The growth of our rewards program, the rollout of Broyhill and the launch of two new initiatives we refer to as life's occasions and traffic drivers.",
        "Starting with Store of the Future, our results continue to be strong. We started 2019 with approximately 200 stores in the new format and through Q2 we've remodeled an additional 123. The team is on time and on budget with the remodels as we approach the final phases of work for the year and we're on pace to finish additional 91 stores by the end of October or just in time for the high volume holiday selling season in Q4. Sales lifts in the first year after remodel continue to be in the high single-digit range with the vast majority of the increase coming from the margin rich categories of furniture, seasonal and soft home. The stores in year two after the remodel also continued to perform well and in general are outperforming the balance of chain.",
        "Store of the Future was a significant contributor to the comp in Q2, adding nearly one point to the result, with the lift coming from a balance of an increase in transactions in a bigger basket. This is very encouraging as the transaction growth is coming from higher traffic to our stores, which is a great unlock for the business. Moreover, our net promoter scores in these stores are posting strong increases, further validating that this model is resonating with our customer. Taking into account new stores will enter the peak holiday selling period this year with 250 more stores in a new format as compared to last year. Store of the Future program began before I joined the Company, and it fits in very well with the growth initiatives that we are working on under Operation North Star.",
        "Store of the Future has the capacity to grow and adapt as we do and as we rollout Store of the Future class of 2020, we will use the learnings from the initial rollouts to further enhance the return on investment. Our new stores are performing very well with many recent openings producing results at or above the highest marks in our Company history. In the second quarter, high volume new store openings plus successful remodels added 130 basis points to total sales growth, the largest contribution we've seen from new stores in years. The majority of these openings are relocations where we've appropriately sized the store to showcase the merchandise categories of furniture, seasonal and soft home, while ensuring we have ample space to surprise and delight our customers with additional assortments throughout the store.",
        "We estimate approximately 50 new or relocated stores this year, resulting in net positive new store openings for the first time since 2012. Most importantly, however, we see significant new store growth potential going forward, aided by the new productivity driving initiatives across our fleet under Operation North Star. We expect this to be a meaningful lever of growth going forward. Our e-com team delivered another quarter of significantly improved operating results while successfully launching and rolling out BOPUS, that is buy online pickup in stores to all stores over the past few weeks. This is a big win for our team and we are highly encouraged by the results so far. BOPUS has nearly doubled the number of viewable SKUs online and our customers response has been better than expected. We're receiving more orders per day per store than anticipated. And the average order value is higher than our original estimates. She has been purchasing mostly seasonal products and furniture, items readily available on biglots.com. And she often makes additional purchases in store when she picks up her order. In addition, food and consumables assortments are eligible for BOPUS, making this popular shopping option even more convenient for her.",
        "BOPUS is an excellent way for us to capitalize on the continued strong growth in our online traffic and we see much more upside in the e-com channel going forward. Next, our Rewards loyalty program, which reached yet another record in Q2, ending the quarter with 18.3 million active members, an all time high. We added approximately 568,000 active members in the quarter, increasing the membership base 16% year-over-year. We also achieved record loyalty program penetration for sales and transactions in Q2, both posting significant increases over L1 [Phonetic]. The marketing team continues to do a great job leveraging this base of loyal customers with messages directed at her where she consumes media, whether it would be email, social or digital channels.",
        "We know our rewards members shop our stores more frequently and typically drive a bigger basket, highlighting the importance of these loyal customers. Currently, sign-ups are split 50-50 between in-store and online. We believe growing our rewards database will provide increasing opportunities to understand and leverage customer segmentation going forward.",
        "Turning to some newer opportunities under our Life's Occasions initiative, we have carved out an area in front of the store called The Lot, comprising approximately 500 square feet in which we will feature a series of programs focused on lifetime events. The lot will be an innovation engine for the store, bringing newness, freshness and novelty with traffic driving assortments and new categories like apparel that expand our right to play. Our first test occurred in six stores in Q2, with the addition of new fixed ring signage and a bundled curated assortment with elevated quality and value for dorm savings, a new approach to the back to campus theme. The offering was supported with specific marketing messaging through digital channels and print circulars, and the customers response was very encouraging, with incremental sales lifts in these stores.",
        "In August, the lot transitioned to an assortment focused on backyard bargains, and the response has been even stronger with higher sales lists. Repeat shopping trips and favorable feedback from customer intercepts. Based on her reaction, we are evaluating how extensively The Lot can be incorporated into our 2020 plan. We'll have more details on the next call in December, but in the interim, I hope some of you will have the chance to visit the stores where we have created The Lot. Andy can provide a list.",
        "Next our traffic drivers initiative is focused on providing assortments to drive foot traffic to our stores and help our customer to find more items on our list. The traffic drivers initiative arose from our customer research and includes the addition of a significant number of SKUs in brand name consumable never our products. We believe the consistent availability of these SKUs will drive increased frequency of visits to our stores, supporting sales and other higher margin categories. Meanwhile, we will still surprise her with closeouts. Earlier this week we've launched traffic drivers in 24 initial locations, transitioning 80 linear feed from food staple items to consumables.",
        "We are planning an extensive rollout of this initiative in 2020 and are excited about the potential. Alongside this, we are also looking at product density opportunities, including the possibility of new fixture and configurations with a front end queue area. A further work stream is focused on strengthening our presence in home with the launch of Broyhill representing our first step. We're on track for a soft launch in January 2020 and expanded our full launch a few months later. This iconic brand will be a growth driver, not only in furniture, but also in our seasonal soft and hard home categories with emphasis on a better and best offerings.",
        "As you can see, we have many significant growth opportunities in the pipeline and we are confident that these will drive a new chapter of growth for Big Lots, with a strong return on invested capital. We will quantify this opportunity more over our next couple of earnings call s. Alongside these growth initiatives, we have also maintain a strong focus on the second pillar of our strategy, funding the journey. We have already announced that we expect to achieve cumulative cost savings over the next three years of $100 million. We are well on our way to driving that number higher and we'll give further updates on future earnings calls as we continue to validate opportunities to be more efficient.",
        "As an example, in Q2 we improved our in-store labor model with a new, simpler management structure designed to improve the shopping experience by focusing more of our resources on serving the customer. Ensuring we are optimizing the impact of our expense dollars will be an ongoing focus for the Company. Overall, we remain confident that we are on the right track with Operation North Star. We're making strategic investments that will generate returns well in excess of our cost of capital and the results from this work will become increasingly evident as we move forward.",
        "I'm excited about the progress on these existing initiatives, all focused on our customers living Big and saving Lots. We are just at the beginning of this journey, but expect to make significant progress over the next 12 to 24 months.",
        "Now, turning to the second quarter, it was another good one for the Company with sales growth and comps inline with guidance and adjusted EPS above expectations. We were pleased to deliver these results despite a challenging and uncertain environment caused by trade tensions and import tariffs. As we will review in a moment, we expect the back half of the year to remain challenging, in particular due to the growing impact of tariffs. But we are confident we can navigate through this and deliver a good result for the year.",
        "Total sales for the quarter grew 2.5%, the highest level of growth since Q3 of 2018, and comparable store sales increased 1.2%, our fifth consecutive quarter of positive comps and on top of a 1.6% increase in the second quarter of last year. Lisa will discuss the merchandise category performance in a moment. But at a high level, the four businesses where the customer gives us the most permission to play furniture, soft home, seasonal consumables, once again drove the top line increase in the quarter. At this level, sales growth we recorded adjusted EPS of $0.53, which was above the high end of our guidance range. Their earnings beat was primarily attributed to lower expense levels that Jonathan will review later in the call.",
        "I'll now hand the call over to Lisa for more detail on Q2 merchandising results, but I'll return to make some closing remarks in a few moments.",
        "Lisa Bachmann -- Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Operating Officer",
        "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce highlighted, Q2 was a good quarter from a sales perspective, with comps increasing 1.2%, in line with our guidance of a low single digit lift, which is particularly encouraging in light of the slow start in May, resulting from poor weather conditions across most of the country. For the seven divisions comped up in the quarter, and with the understandable exception of seasonal in the month of May, all four of them posted positive results each month in quarter two. In addition, the strength was broad-based within these divisions, with most or all departments consistently contributing to the increases.",
        "From a merchandise category perspective, furniture was the top performer, up high single digits, which is on top of a 4% increase last year. Congratulations to the team for an excellent quarter. All four departments, that is upholstery, mattresses, casegoods and ready-to-assemble were strong in Q2.",
        "Jennifer continues to love our motion sofas and loveseats, an offering we expanded this year, and mattresses had a very good quarter, driven in part by a successful Memorial Day event. Our two convenient financing options for in-store purchases are also very popular with her. Easy leasing the lease to purchase program offered through progressive, comped the comp once again in Q2 growing double digits with penetration and furniture sales reaching 20% in the quarter. And the Big Lots credit card administered by our partners at Alliance Data Systems had record setting growth not only in furniture transactions, but across many categories in the store. We're in the process of improving the card program with refreshed creative, more prominent in-store signage, a new look for the card and the addition of exclusive events for cardholders. We believe this is a positive sign of things to come for the Big Lots credit card.",
        "We are also executing the transition from Serta to Sealy mattresses in the majority of our stores. The Sealy brand has a strong quality perception and has performed very well in our larger format stores currently offering both Sealy and Serta mattresses. This expanded partnership will increase our ability to offer more frequent updates of styles, features and technology and elevate the excitement factor in this key category, while funding future growth opportunities. And while the majority of our in-store mattress assortment will be Sealy, we will continue to carry the Serta brand in all stores with an expanded offering in our larger format stores as well as online.",
        "Next is soft home, up low single-digits, another very good job by the team who have extended their streak to 22 consecutive quarters of comp growth in this high margin category. Seven of eight departments were up in Q2 with notable strength in home decor, home organization and flooring. This business continues to benefit from our initiative to increase density and find better uses of space. For instance, home decor leverage never out sets an additional improved density on our end caps to comp up low double-digits. Consumables was also up low single-digits. Congratulations to the team who are celebrating their third consecutive quarter of positive comps. The increase in Q2 spanned four of five departments and was driven in part by expanded cleaning aides and our housekeeping business and never outsets in health and beauty.",
        "Paper and pet also posted very good results for the quarter. Our customer gives us high permission to play in consumables, which has been an important learning for Big. This traffic driving category is one of our most productive from a linear foot perspective, which bodes well as we look to expand it in the future. Seasonal was up low single digits, a solid performance for the team, all things considered. The relevance and sell-through of lawn and garden, summer assortment is highly correlated with warm and dry weather and our best chance to sell these products at full ticket occurs in the months leading up to Memorial Day holiday.",
        "Last year, after a very cool and wet spring, Mother Nature cooperated with good weather in May in the months to follow. And Jennifer responded in a big way driving up the business approximately 10%, both in the month of May and for Q2. This year, we weren't as fortunate with the weather card in May and sales were pressured down mid single-digits in the month. As conditions improved in June and July, sales improved, although many occurred as we executed our markdown cadence to clear space for back to campus Halloween and harvest. Food was down in the quarter as industry wide competition continues to intensify for this business.",
        "In addition, as a reminder, our Store of the Future format reduces the space allocated to the food category. We did see a couple of bright spots in Q2, namely candy, snacks and beverage products. However, the overall softness of pantry and staple-type items pressured category results. Recently, we're seeing encouraging trends coming from our food reset that was completed at the beginning of Q2. In this reset, we redirected inventory and space to entertaining categories where we have a high permission to play, including beverage, salty snacks, cookies and candy. And we created destination assortments for coffee and healthy snacking. We also reduced our space in food staples by eight feet and deployed to consumables. Electronics, toys and accessories was also down in Q2, consistent with our internal planning. One business to call out, however, toys comped up mid single-digits in the quarter, driven by a relevant assortment of on trend branded product.",
        "Congratulations to the toys team for a very good start to the year. We're excited for the months to come as the team has identified incremental opportunities with new vendors and products for our customer as she prepares for the upcoming holiday season. And finally, hard home was down in Q2, driven primarily by two significant category edits. First, as announced last quarter, we exited greeting cards, and second, we reduced the space for everyday stationary 50%, both were done to accommodate expanding businesses where we have a higher permission to play. We did see good performance in a few departments, including tabletop, food prep and small kitchen appliances, but the increases were offset by other category declines.",
        "Before heading the call over, I want to take a moment to thank our team for the extra effort spent over the last few weeks and months on the topic of import tariffs. We clearly understand the importance of price and value to Jennifer, and we're proactively addressing what often feels like a moving target. Since the very first announcement more than a year ago, the team has been carefully assessing the products on each of the four lists and the potential impact on Big. They have done a very good job managing through the impact with short term measures, including working with manufacturers both import and domestic to reduce overall cost, adjusting retail prices where appropriate and evaluating the overall number of units purchased.",
        "Our exposure to tariffs this year has been predominantly but not exclusively items on List 3, and the overall impact has been managed very well. List 4A and 4B will have minimal impact this year. In some cases we are adjusting prices, but we are also expecting to absorb some margin impact until the situation stabilizes. The team has also spent a great deal of time, developing longer term solutions, if the current tariff environment and the related unpredictability does not abate.",
        "I'll now turn the call over to Jonathan for insight on the numbers and our guidance for 2019.",
        "Jonathan Ramsden -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer",
        "Thanks, Lisa and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by saying, I am thrilled to be here at Big Lots, and excited to work with Bruce and the whole team as we move forward on our strategic business transformation. Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 were $1.252 billion, up 2.5% versus the $1.222 billion we've reported last year. The increase in total sales resulted from our positive comp and sales growth in high volume new stores, not included in the comp base, partially offset by a slightly lower store count year-over-year.",
        "Comparable store sales, for stores open at least 15 months plus e-commerce sales increased 1.2% compared to our guidance of a low single digit increase. In terms of the cadence throughout the quarter, comps were up in each of the three months with a slow start in May that Lisa mentioned a moment ago. June posting the best result and July, generally in line with Q2. Adjusted income for the second quarter was $20.6 million or $0.53 per diluted share, which compared to our guidance of $0.35 to $0.45 per diluted share and income of $24.2 million or $0.59 per diluted share for the same period last year. The gross margin rate for Q2 was 39.8%, which was down from last year's second quarter rate of 40.2%. As anticipated, a higher markdown rate and promotional selling, principally in seasonal product, was only partially offset by the continued favorability we are experiencing in merchandise mix and shrink.",
        "Total adjusted expense dollars were $466 million or up 2% to last year, which was favorable to our guidance of expense growth in the mid single-digits. Depreciation was the largest contributor to the favorability, resulting from the timing of capex spend and an extension in the depreciable life of assets and Store of the Future stores and new stores. As we reviewed our level of capital expenditures for Store of the Future locations in comparison to our remaining expected lease terms on those locations, we determined it appropriate to make this change. The estimated impact of this change is approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2019, of which approximately $6 million was recorded in Q2.",
        "In total, depreciation expense in the quarter was $30 million compared to $30.5 million last year. In addition to depreciation, expense trends were favorable in store operations, transportation, health and welfare and worker's comp, partially offset by higher bonus expense and certain other items.",
        "Our adjusted expense rate in Q2 was 37.2%, down 20 basis points from last year's rate of 37.4%. Interest expense for the quarter was $4.6 million compared to $2.4 million last year. Primarily reflecting a higher average draw on our revolver versus last year, as well as a somewhat higher average interest rate. The adjusted income tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% compared to last year's rate of 24.6%.",
        "Moving on to the balance sheet, inventory ended the second quarter of fiscal 2019 at $874 million compared to $854 million last year, a 2% increase. Inventory levels on a per store basis increased approximately 3%. During Q2, we opened 20 new stores and closed 13 stores, leaving us with 1,411 stores and total selling square footage of $31.7 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $86 million, compared to $58 million last year. The increase in capex aligns with our strategic investments in Store of the Future, our new California DC and a higher number of new store openings year-over-year.",
        "We ended the first quarter with $54 million of cash and cash equivalents and $468 million of borrowings under our credit facility. This compared to $58 million of cash and equivalents and $325 million of borrowings at the end of the second quarter, last year. Our increase in borrowings includes the effects of elevated capex year-over-year, the increase in inventory and the cash impact of non-GAAP costs associated with our strategic transformation. As announced in a separate press release earlier today, on August 28, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per common share. This dividend payment of approximately $12 million is payable on September 27, 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 13th, 2019.",
        "Year-to-date approximately $75 million has been returned to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments. Prior to reviewing our guidance for the balance of the year, I would like to give a brief update on the transition of operations from our existing distribution center in Rancho Cucamonga, California, to our new DC in Apple Valley, California. Based on the pace of user acceptance testing, we are pushing the beginning of the transition out to December for initial card and receipts of the new DC, with a final cut over in January.",
        "Alongside the transition, we are in advanced negotiations to sell the facility in Rancho Cucamonga. We expect to reinvest a portion of the proceeds to exercise a purchase option on our corporate headquarters here in Columbus. With this arrangement providing both favorable tax treatment and lower overall expense going forward. The balance of the anticipated gain net of tax will be used for the pay down of outstanding revolver debt.",
        "Now, turning to forward guidance. For Q3, we expect an adjusted loss of $0.15 to $0.25 per share, which compares to last year's loss of $0.16 per share. Our guidance assumes comparable store sales approximately flat with the positive spread to total sales growth somewhat greater than in Q2. The growth in total sales incorporates the recent positive sales trends in new stores, as well as an increased number of new store openings year-over-year. The gross margin rate for the third quarter is expected to be slightly lower than last year, driven in part by absorbing some of the impact from tariffs. Adjusted expenses, a percent of sales is expected to be lower than last year with favorables in store payroll, corporate headquarters expenses and transportation, partially offset by the California DC transition and Store of the Future related costs.",
        "In terms of our outlook for the full year, we are maintaining our guidance for adjusted income to be in the range of $3.70 to $3.85 per diluted share compared to last year's adjusted EPS of $4.04. This outlook is based on comparable store sales flat to slightly positive. The outlook assumes that the benefit of lower than planned expenses will be substantially offset by gross margin rate pressure in particular from tariffs. The gross margin rate for the full year is expected to be modestly lower than last year and adjusted expenses as a percent of sales are expected to be flat with last year.",
        "Depreciation is now forecasted to be approximately $135 million for the year. In general, as Bruce said earlier, we're committed to driving further expense savings under our fund from the journey initiative and expect this will provide us with insulation against incremental tariff headwinds in 2020. We'll provide an update on our expense savings initiative on the nex t earnings call.",
        "As a reminder, all of our commentary has been on a non-GAAP basis, excluding transformation costs, merchandise category exit costs and legal settlement contingencies. In our press release, we also provided GAAP guidance for fiscal 2019. The level of non-GAAP activity on an after tax basis is in the range of $36 million or $0.90 per diluted share for the year, resulting in cash flow of approximately $75 million which is our prior guidance of $65 million for the year.",
        "I'll now turn the call back over to Bruce.",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "Thanks, Jonathan. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are facing uncertainty in our business due to the impact of tariffs, in a highly competitive environment. However, I'm confident we'll be able to navigate through this environment to deliver a good outcome for 2019. Our existing initiatives in Operation North Star are working and we have important additional initiatives and work streams in the pipeline to be rolled out over the next 12 months to 24 months focused on profitable long-term growth.",
        "I want to take a moment to thank our associates in the field and here in the corporate office for their dedication, passion and contributions as we execute this major transformation for the Company. As I look forward, I've never been more excited about Big Lots future. We are rolling out growth initiatives that will make us more relevant and competitive. We are proactively bending our cost curve to fuel the growth going forward, and we have a resilient, nimble and dedicated team, the best in retail to get after our fair share and possibly more of the value store marketplace. We expect these efforts to result in strong returns for our shareholders.",
        "I'll now turn the call back over to Andy.",
        "Andrew D. Regrut -- Vice President, Investor Relations",
        "Thanks, Bruce. Operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.",
        "Brad Thomas -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst",
        "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and welcome, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan Ramsden -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer",
        "Thank you, Brad.",
        "Brad Thomas -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst",
        "I wanted to first get into the guidance a little bit. You haven't given explicit fourth quarter guidance, but obviously we can see what's implied here from the full year in the third quarter. And I'm backing into about $2.45 to $2.60 for the fourth quarter. I guess as you think about the current trajectory of the business and the impact from tariffs, can you help us think about, how to model that whole important fourth quarter for you?",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "Yeah, Brad. As you say, we haven't given to you a specific guidance for the fourth quarter, but you can't back into it broadly from the third quarter and the full year guidance. We've given -- we are holding our full year EPS range, I think what you can extrapolate as you look at the fourth quarter is that the comp trend is sort of broadly in line with what we're projecting for Q3. I think what we're also projecting into Q4 is some gross margin rate erosion, in particular allowing for the incremental impact of tariffs in Q4, as we're also seeing some of that in Q3. So, I think that the main sort of your point is that you can infer from the gains we've given for the balance of the year.",
        "Brad Thomas -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst",
        "That's helpful. And if I could ask a question about some of the strategies to drive growth going forward, we've been seeing you and your emails advertise closeouts, so a little bit more I was wondering Bruce, if you could talk about how the role of closeouts has been evolving of late and how that might fit into your strategy going forward?",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "No problem. Thanks, Brad. Closeouts are still very important to us, primarily in the food categories and the consumable category, where they still represent around up to 25% of the offering. Overall in the store it's around 9%, 10%, but we are still always top of mind for vendors that are dealing with closeouts. We get to pick from the list, it's a nice surprise and delight in those categories, I just mentioned. But alongside that, what we're doing now with the traffic driving test is also offering her an opportunity to shop the brands she loves. And those brands are things that she can depend on, they're never out brands.",
        "And what's nice about this proposition of having closeouts next to those traffic driving brands in food and consumables -- primarily in consumables, is that she gets to see a competitive price in that area and also gets the surprise and delight of a closeout offering, which for many times could be 10% to 40% lower than other competitors. So it's a nice offering where -- what we're up against in competition wise is maybe a manufacturing coupon. So it's got a very important role. Our customer insights tell us that she is all about surprise and delight in the treasure hunt and loves a great deal, so it's important in those categories.",
        "Brad Thomas -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst",
        "Great. Thank you very much.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question.",
        "Joseph Feldman -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst",
        "Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to understand, it sounded like the comp trend maybe got a little better in June and July, with once weather was cleared out. And so I'm trying to -- I guess, understand why the -- your forecast came down for the second half, what changed? I guess, especially with some price pass through of some of the tariffs, I would have thought that you'd be able to maybe see some of that in ticker.",
        "Jonathan Ramsden -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer",
        "Yeah. Hey, Joe. Yeah, so the cadence we talk to for the second quarter was the -- May was relatively tough because of your weather and other factors. June was pretty strong and July was broadly in line with the comp for the quarter as a whole. I think when you look at Q2 to Q3, we're not looking at a significant sequential change in the comp relative to where we came in at the end of Q2. As you know, in the back half of the year, we are up against some -- somewhat higher comps in the back half of last year. But again, I wouldn't characterize the change we're making as being very dramatic in the overall scheme of things.",
        "Joseph Feldman -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst",
        "Understood. Thanks. And then just a follow up with regard to the $36 million in charges for the year, can you remind us maybe just the major buckets where -- what those things are? Just to refresh our memory on that.",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "Yeah, I mean, just the three big buckets of that. The first is your transformation costs associated with our Operation North Star. So the costs of executing that project, with some severance and other costs related to that execution. We also had some legal contingencies that we booked in Q1, and then we had some exit costs relating to our exit of the greeting card, specifically that we recorded in Q1. So most charges, we believe are substantially behind us at this point. We are not anticipating significant ongoing non-GAAP adjustments. There are a couple of things that may run through related to the Operation North Star transformation. But broadly, we believe that's behind us at this point.",
        "Joseph Feldman -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst",
        "Got it. Thank you and good luck with this quarter. Thanks.",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "Thanks.",
        "Jonathan Ramsden -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer",
        "Thanks, Joe.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.",
        "Paul Trussell -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst",
        "Hi, good morning.",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "Good morning, Paul.",
        "Paul Trussell -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst",
        "Certainly understand the seasonal markdown pressure that may have took place in the second quarter impacting your gross margins, maybe just talk a little bit about the go forward puts and takes as it relates to gross margin? Thank you.",
        "Jonathan Ramsden -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer",
        "I'll be happy to jump in on that Paul, and then maybe Lisa or Bruce may want to add something.",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "Yeah, what we said at the back of the year, we have taken down our gross margin rate guidance in particular to allow for the expectation that we're going to need to absorb some of the impact on tariffs, I think the headline. But I'll let Lisa expound on that.",
        "Lisa Bachmann -- Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Operating Officer",
        "Yeah. Again, I think, from what we saw in second quarter, you're right. We had pressure from a seasonal perspective. But also, we're learning from the tariff implications, what we're doing from a pricing perspective. And we really believe in continuing to offer that value proposition for Jennifer. And I think our guidance reflects some of the headwinds there, but we're comfortable with where we are setting from a margin perspective.",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "And Paul, I'll just add a few more things. Look, everybody's talking about tariffs, they're talking about trade tensions, it's all over the headlines, you're on every call hearing it as well. I think the thing that we want to portray here is Big Lots, there is always a great value before this, and we'll continue to be a great value going forward. And consumer sentiment is still strong. In some cases we'll raise prices, in some cases we'll negotiate costs, will decrease units as it makes sense, change sourcing and will also make room on our P&L to compete and win, and that's what you're seeing there. We will continue to deliver and hope to have good results for 2019 and plan 2020 accordingly.",
        "Paul Trussell -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst",
        "Thank you. And as it relates to the Store of the Future, certainly continue to see our really strong results in year-one and now kind of above average gains in year two. Just as you guys have continued to observe the progress, just curious on any updates on ultimately how many stores you believe you can put this format in? Any tweaks that you all are making along the way? And ultimately any changes in thoughts around the cadence of openings going forward?",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "Paul, this is Bruce, I'll take that. First half, let me just say, I'm very excited about Store of the Future. I love the fact that I came to the Company and it was already in place, because it creates just a fantastic foundation for our future growth. You're right still in first year, we get high single-digit less and in second year, we're still very pleased. Phoenix being our market that we're really, really pleased with. Other markets are generally up as well and we're happy about that. The Store of the Future is exciting and we're learning as we go through it, that there is new things we can do. One, some of the things that we are looking at is how do we do it more efficiently and effectively from a cost perspective. As you know, our investment is around $400,000, $500,000 per store, it produces high mid-teen IRR results, which is much greater than our weighted average cost of capital. So we're pleased with that.",
        "I think the other thing that I like about it is, is that at the end of this year, we'll be a third of our fleet in the new format Store of the Future, which is about 465 stores. We have a schedule and a cadence that has us completing our fleet or the majority of our fleet maybe there'll be 10% plus left, that would make sense to convert, but completing that by Q3 and 2021. And while we do this, it opens up a very valuable platform for us to introduce new concepts like we've talked about on this call, The Lot, and other things that really create surprise and delight in a structured clean environment, in a neighborhood store that she just absolutely loves. So we're learning on -- learning much about where the future and we're very excited about what is doing and what we'll continue to do.",
        "Paul Trussell -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst",
        "Thank you. Best of luck.",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "Thank you, Paul.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.",
        "Robert Friedner -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst",
        "Hey, good morning, it's actually Bobby Friedner on for Peter. Thanks for taking the questions. First on the SG&A, I think you mentioned about some layoffs in stores and based on Q3 guidance, it seems like there is pretty healthy SG&A leverage. I guess you just gave a little color around the strategy behind the layoffs and how much that's contributing to actually no improvement in the back-half? Thanks.",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "Hey Bobby, this is Bruce, I'll comment on it. You know, it's always very difficult to say goodbye to employees that have worked with us, they're like family to us, so it's difficult. But the process really came out of the results of us doing some benchmark studies and understanding that in many stores, not all, but in many stores we were top heavy. And what we really needed to do was translate that structure to a more nimble structure where we invested the hours and more customer facing hours. And so the result of it, while there is a cost benefit to it, the result is a stronger customer facing team in every store with better leadership structure. And the results are were getting increased net promoter score ratings over the last month. So, we're -- it's a very difficult decision to do that, but it was the right decision for our go forward.",
        "Robert Friedner -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst",
        "Got it. I appreciate that color. And then separately on tariffs, so now you're through a season that had price increases in part due to tariffs. How do you feel about the consumers reaction to higher prices? And have you noticed any changes to unit velocities on SKUs you've raised price on?",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "You know, it's -- Bobby, it's still early, but I would say from a macro viewpoint and marketplace viewpoint, we believe consumer sentiment is still very strong. I think some of the headlines in the news will cause skepticism to increase and that's highly correlated to spend, although I don't think the consumer is cutting back anytime soon here, that could prove differently if the tensions continue. But having said that, really what impacted us as of late was the List 3, as Lisa mentioned in our prepared notes. And we have taken the measures to mitigate that and keep working through it, and we'll do that through List 4, and beyond.",
        "Robert Friedner -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst",
        "All right. Thanks a lot. Good luck in back half.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Prykull with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.",
        "Christopher Prykull -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst",
        "Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I just had a follow up related to the D&A comments that you made. I think -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you said there was a benefit of about $12 million to $14 million this year, but you reiterated the full year EPS guidance, so essentially lowered EBITDA guide. Is the reduction in the EBITDA guide solely related to tariffs or were there other drivers? And then maybe help square that with the increase in free cash flow guidance?",
        "Jonathan Ramsden -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer",
        "Yeah. We have to do -- good morning, Chris. Yes, so we talked about a $12 million to $14 million full year benefit from changing the lives of our Store of the Future related assets, so that's obviously benefit relative to where we were. What we're seeing in the opposite direction as we talked about is gross margin rate pressure in the second half of the year, which largely is offsetting that benefit. So to your point, that is closing EBITDA to come down to some degree, relative to where we were. The offset for that in terms of the free cash flow guidance is the capex is a bit low -- quite a bit lower than our prior expectation. We're getting some benefit in things like maintenance capex. We had a handful of stores drop-off, the Store of the Future list, so there is a little bit of a saving there.",
        "And just generally, we're trying to sharpen our pencil on capex, as we go through the year and making sure that we're spending that capex as efficiently as we can. So we're realizing some savings as we do that. So they were the two big deltas in the increase. Lower EBITDA, as you pointed out, offset by lower capex on a full year basis.",
        "Christopher Prykull -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst",
        "Okay, great. That's really helpful. Thanks for the clarification. And then maybe a bigger picture question, can you walk us through your thoughts around maybe the strategic rationale for store growth? How you're thinking about, the annual growth rate going forward? Do you have a long-term store target? Do you have an annual unit opening target? Just some more color there would be helpful.",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "Yeah, Chris this is Bruce. I'll start-off and ask Jonathan to round out. First and foremost, just really pleased that this year is our first year of net positive store growth, since 2012, I believe, which is great. We did as part of our Operation North Star study, we did a whole marketplace analysis to understand how big is Big in terms of brick-and-mortar footprint. And that got us excited about what could be. We're still working through those numbers, as we look at from the demographics in the financials around that. Can you actually get the space? And so we're excited about what that could be. It does make sense for us. Many of our customers depend on brick-and-mortar, and as we look at online and omni-channel as well, they play nicely together. So what I will tell you is that our new stores that we've opened have performed better than expected, and they get high -- actually mid-teen IRR results, very consistent and we're good at opening these stores. We've got a great team doing that. And so we see it as a potential meaningful growth opportunity for us along with our online growth in an omnichannel world.",
        "Jonathan Ramsden -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer",
        "Yeah. And Chris, just to add to that, as Bruce said here, we think there is a significant potential opportunity in new stores. We're not ready to fully quantify that yet. But we're encouraged by the performance of the new stores we have opened. We've got a track record of opening new stores with very reliable ROIs, which are well above our cost of capital. So we're looking at the runway on that going forward and we'll give more color over the next couple o f earnings calls. The one other thing I would add is that as our other initiatives, you've got a momentum and drive productivity higher, that potentially increases the number of opportunities we have to open new stores with returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.",
        "Christopher Prykull -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst",
        "Great. Thanks so much. Enjoy the long weekend and good luck to the rest of the year.",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "You too. Thank you.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.",
        "Anthony Chukumba -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst",
        "Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So I just had a question, you commented on food and the fact that the competitive environment continues to be quite fierce. I guess, I was just looking for a little bit more color there. Is that, that there are more retailers out there selling food. Is it that everyday prices have come down? Is it that, there is more promotions that sort of a combination of all those things? And how do you -- I mean, I know you're making some tweaks to your merchandising in terms of -- focusing, it sounds like more on snacks, but I was just wondering how you sort of combat that? Thanks.",
        "Lisa Bachmann -- Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Operating Officer",
        "Hi, Anthony, I'll jump in on that one. As we indicated, Jennifer is really responding within our assortment to some more -- more of that entertaining type product. So the snacking, the candy, the beverage, the coffees and we are seeing a slowdown in the staple products. But the good news is our most productive area in food are the snacking categories. So we really want to lean into those, and that's what Q2s assortment change reflected for us. And we also will really be taking advantage of some of those traffic driving items during the back half of the year, that have really resonated with Jennifer within that category. And of course, when we do that, we see a really nice overall halo to the entire store.",
        "Anthony Chukumba -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst",
        "That's helpful. Thank you.",
        "Lisa Bachmann -- Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Operating Officer",
        "Yeah.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.",
        "Renato Oscar Basanta -- Barclays Bank -- Analyst",
        "Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Renato Basanta on the line for Karen. Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, so just to -- just a follow up on Paul's question on Store of the Future. Can you just remind us how many stores you had in year two in the second quarter and how many you'll have by 3Q? And then as you lap here, one for these stores, I'm curious if you're seeing any meaningful changes in the way the customers shopping the store in year two, whether from a category basket or frequency perspective? Any color there would be helpful.",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "I can give you a couple of data points on that, and then we'll hopefully answer your specific question. So we started the year with 200 stores in the Store of the Future format. We have about 215 [Phonetic] we're expecting to remodel over the course of the year, plus a 50 new stores are in the Store of the Future format. So that brings us up to that sort of 460-ish or so count by the end of the year. In the comp base at the beginning of Q3, there were 260 Store of the Futures.",
        "Renato Oscar Basanta -- Barclays Bank -- Analyst",
        "Okay. And then just any changes in the customer -- the way the customer shopping the store in year two versus year one? Or maybe you like frequency or basket or anything like that?",
        "Lisa Bachmann -- Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Operating Officer",
        "I'd was tell you from a category performance perspective. As you know, we've seen great lifts within our furniture, soft home and seasonal. And those categories continue to drive the performance in year two. Again, the higher margin categories. So we're pleased with the results that we're seeing with those categories, it's been very consistent.",
        "Renato Oscar Basanta -- Barclays Bank -- Analyst",
        "Okay. And then just my second question is really related to e-commerce, specifically profitability, as you know, you rolled out BOPUS. I was hoping you could just dive deeper into the trends there and maybe talk about the puts and takes on profitability? You maybe seeing and perhaps just share any metrics you may be tracking as you gauge progress? Thanks.",
        "Jonathan Ramsden -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer",
        "Yeah, I'll start that. Thanks Renato. The e-comm business continues to get better, I think in '18 we did about $40 million, $45 million in sales with a loss around $8 million, $9 million. This year we've talked about it before, $55 million plus at a lower loss. And on our way to breakeven, potentially profitability in this. As you look at it, one of the things that was very important for us, is knowing that our customer and through the research we did, our customer relies on online. In fact, we know over 20% of her shopping begins online and that's over 50%, roughly around 54% of our customers have an Amazon prime account. That's important to know and that's why we accelerated our launch of BOPUS, buy online, pick-up in store, this year as a pilot back in May. And just late in July, we extended that across our entire fleet, doubling -- nearly doubling the amount of SKUs and offerings to our customer. And what we're really excited about is that she is loving it, she is absolutely loving it. We're pleased to see her buying into furniture, soft home products, as well as all categories in a significant way. Her ticket is bigger, frequency is bigger, good conversion, the stores are enjoying it. When she comes in, she is shopping a little bit more. So our expectations are great for this new capability, and it's a very profitable way to enter online in a more significant way, as we didn't have to ship the SKUs from a centralized DC, they're in the store. So we like that, and it's starting to give us insight into how big it can be and how we can lever it, in Q3, Q4 and 2020, and what else we can do.",
        "I will say that, we continue to grow our loyalty database to customers, 50% of those come from online. So as we grow and lean into this new strategic initiative, we'll see that grow as well. So overall, we continue to get better in e-commerce and we consider it a growth opportunity in the future.",
        "Renato Oscar Basanta -- Barclays Bank -- Analyst",
        "All right. Thanks. Best of luck.",
        "Jonathan Ramsden -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer",
        "Thank you.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from line of Jason Haas with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.",
        "Jason Haas -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst",
        "Great. Thanks for taking my question. How are you thinking about investment needs for The Lot or some of these other merchandising initiatives that you laid out? And then just maybe more broadly, just how you're thinking about capital allocation now between some of these investment opportunities versus debt paydown or buybacks?",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "Good morning, Jason. I'll start-off and maybe hand things off to Jonathan here. Glad you brought up The Lot, we're excited about The Lot. I just want to take a moment to talk about that. The Lot is one of the things that we've come up with from our research Operation North Star, talking to our customers. It really was founded and trialed by the theory, a confirmed theory, that she loves surprise and delight, she loves a great deal, good quality. The Lot fits nicely in our Store of the Future format. It sets up in the front of the store, right when you walk-in, disrupts the shopping pattern, really makes you have to grab a basket or a cart to complete the shopping because it's exciting. It's only 500 square feet -- it's 500 square feet, it's not a meaningful investment in terms of capex for the store. And it's got a nice low single-digit lift in the test stores that we've tried at this point. So it can be a meaningful rollout for us from the future. And this, along with the other strategic initiatives we've labeled -- laid out today, are all part of our next 90 days in sequencing our rollout of all the growth opportunities we have, that will then pretty much lay out a capex plan on operating plan, etc. So we're in the mix of it right now, and I'll hand that off to Jonathan to add anything.",
        "Jonathan Ramsden -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer",
        "Sure. Let me just -- thanks, Bruce. Hi, Jason, let me first just comment on debt levels, so the end of Q2, as you've seen, we were up about $145 million year-over-year. We expect that delta to significantly abate as we go through the balance of the year. And if we complete our sale of the California DC within the fiscal year, we would expect to be in a better position year-over-year with our debt levels at the end of the year. If not, we would at least be closer to where we were at the end of last year. So we do see the debt level coming down somewhat over the balance of the year. From a go-forward capital allocation perspective, I think broadly our philosophy will remain to allocate capital to where we're going to get the greatest risk adjusted return, that's the determination of the process that we all could continue to look at quarter-by-quarter, as we go forward. It's a little early, as Bruce just said, for us to give specific commentary on that coming into 2020. But as we get to December and certainly as we get to the March earnings call, we'll be able to give a lot more color on how we're thinking about that going into 2020. Once we got more visibility on the return on invested capital of all these different projects, that we're currently executing. I think the important point is, we see many opportunities in the pipeline with a very strong return on investment, well ahead of our weighted average cost of cap.",
        "Jason Haas -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst",
        "Great. Thank you. And then as a follow up, I had a question on just how you're thinking about mitigating the tariff impact. I understand there is an impact this year, but I'm just going forward do you think there is more offsets maybe to come in terms of -- I think China represents about 21% of your direct imports. So there is any potential to take down that number or just any other potential offsets to think about as we think about the go forward number?",
        "Bruce Thorn -- Chief Executive Officer & President",
        "Jason. Thanks, Jason. Just to hit on a few points here. We're all dealing with the tariffs, trade tensions, etc.",
        "The way that we've been dealing with it is changing prices where it makes sense, negotiating the costs with vendors, dropping the units where it makes sense. Also making room on the P&L to compete and win in the moment. And one of those areas is changing the sourcing, that takes a little longer. But we did have a start on that from work we've done in the past, and we've moved some where it makes sense. And you've got to be cautious about that as well, because everyone is running to another country, and then it becomes capacity and quality issues, etc. So we're all dealing with this. And I guess really the takeaway is, it's out of our control. We deal with it. Big Lots was a great value before the trade tensions hit and well position and we'll remain a good value to our customers through it and afterwards, and so we'll continue to mitigate it with everything we have.",

We expect Qian joining us half a year ago and has helped in understanding into our companies strategy, financial situation and the business. We believe his participation will help the company achieve the next stage of growth. Mr. Qian, please.",
        "Raphael Qian -- Chief Financial Officer",
        "Thank you Mr. Chen. I'm very excited to join the company and looking forward to working with Mr. Chen and the team to deliver the next phase of growth. Hello, everyone. I'm glad to speak with you on today's call. We delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. If excluding the trading gain and losses, which is more volatile with market dynamics, we did an apple-to-apple comparison with our core business Y-o-Y and Q-o-Q basis, and we are very happy to report that we nearly achieved breakeven.",
        "We grew assets and invested to drive growth, while still delivering operating leverage, as a result we are pleased with these results and we will continue to focus on extracting our strategy.",
        "Let's now review our Q2 business results in great depth. We've finished the quarter at RMB289 million in total revenues, up by 10% sequentially, driven by the strong demand in our commodities and the security services. If you look simply at the net commissions and the fees generated by our so to call product lines, which was RMB309 million, representing an annualized growth rate of 41.8% and 25.4% from the previous quarter. This comprised 56.6% of commodities related business and the 43.3% of security related business. Total customer trading volume was RMB571.6 billion, up by 39.8% year-over-year and the 5 -- 58.5% from the previous quarter. 85.7% of which was from commodities and the rest was from securities. In fact, if you read from commodities and overseas securities, brokerage services for the quarter were 0.036% and 0.053% respectively, within the reasonable range of movement if you compare year-over-year and the quarter-over-quarter.",
        "Now, turning to our expenses, they were RMB328.1 million, an increase of 4.3% year-over-year. And a 7.1% from the previous quarter. However, if you compare the growth of revenues from our core business -- advantage of scale was clear to see. As we demonstrated a strong growth in our total net commissions which increased 41.8% Y-over-Y and 25.4% Q-o-Q. As a result, our net loss attributable to Yintech for the quarter was RMB55 million compared with net loss of RMB48.5 million in the same quarter last year, and the net income of the RMB69.2 million in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Yintech for the quarter was RMB42.1 million compared with net loss of RMB31 million in the same quarter last year and the net income of RMB85.6 million in the previous quarter.",
        "Diluted loss per ADS for the quarter was RMB0.76 compared with diluted loss per ADS of RMB0.66 in the same quarter last year and the diluted earnings per ADS of RMB0.92 in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP diluted loss per ADS for the quarter was RMB0.58 compared with non-GAAP diluted loss per ADS of RMB0.42 in the same quarter last year. And the non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS of RMB1.14 in the previous quarter.",
        "As of June 30, 2019 the company had RMB1,858.2 million equivalent to US$217.7 million in cash and short term investments compared with RMB1,753.2 million as of March 31, 2019.",
        "Now we are talking about the business outlook. Based on the information available as of the date of this press release Yintech provides the following outlook for the third quarter, which reflects the company's current and preliminary review and is subject to change. Revenues from commissions, interest income and other revenues will be in the range of RMB380 million to RMB400 million. While revenues from trading gains and losses will be in the range of net RMB10 million to RMB30 million. This concludes our prepared remarks for today.",
        "Operator, we will now open the call to questions. Thank you.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Lew Lily [Phonetic] with JP Morgan.",
        "Lew Lily -- JP Morgan -- Analyst",
        "Hi, Mr. Chen and Mr. Qian. Thanks for taking my question. This is Lily with JP Morgan. So I have few questions regarding your asset management business. So from the introduction, I know that this business is relatively new to your group. So could you please introduce more about it -- your asset management business. For example, the statistics of our products and your current AUM. And also, I'm quite curious about your target and plan on this new business line going forward. Thanks.",
        "Yvonne Young -- Investor Relations Director",

        "Thank you. Let me translate.",
        "Wenbin Chen -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer",
        "Currently, we have launched 13 products with total AUM of RMB1.4 billion and including eight loan only equity for that. We see a size of RMB700 million and then three convertible bonds for that with a size of RMB800 million, and then one mutual strategy for that one product with a total size of RMB100 million. To note, we launched the first CD product in July 2018. We believe we are the first mover on this product among the similar competitors in China with a relatively large team and with good performance, as we introduced the 30th. Well, in the meantime, we highly emphasis on compliance and risk and we paid a lot of attention and effort on refining our management, on increasing our AUM and also on maintaining sustainable performance for all of our equity and the convertible bonds further in order to better serve our clients. So our profit [Phonetic] for the assets management business is for one maintaining a sustainable performance growth. And two, is to create absolute returns for our clients. Lily did we answer your question.",
        "Lew Lily -- JP Morgan -- Analyst",
        "Yes. Thanks for the detailed and clear answer. Thank you very much.",

        "Thank you.",

        "Thank you. And the next question comes from James Chang with Jersey [Phonetic] International.",
        "James Chang -- Jersey International -- Analyst",
        "Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations for a great quarter. I would like to have a question for Mr. Chen. Given the macro backdrop has been quite volatile over the past few months and you said in your call. I was hoping to hear your perspective on how you are seeing at this point in the year about the market and how it's going to impact your business. What are the underlying opportunities or risk to you? And I have another question to Mr. Qian about your expenses. It is good to see your opex percentage decrease substantially on yearly and quarterly basis. Can you give us some colors on how you're going to manage your costs going forward? And do we expect the same level, of cost declines? What are the normal run rate for you? As many Internet critics brokerage firms spending heavily on acquiring customers, what is your study then? Do we expect some significant pickup on spending in line with your anticipated growth rates, especially when market is trending more bullish. Thanks.",
        "Yvonne Young -- Investor Relations Director",
        "James, thank you very much for the question. That's a very good one for us. Let me translate for the benefit -- let me translate first for our Chairman and CEO. [Foreign Speech]",
        "Wenbin Chen -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "Yvonne Young -- Investor Relations Director",
        "Let me take a moment to translate for all investors.",
        "Wenbin Chen -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer",
        "Well, yes, as you just now mentioned and also I cited in my speech, just now, that we are reaching [Phonetic] the high volatility of the overall market from both political, economic and capital markets perspective. And then secondly, we have seen that China is on transitioning from the -- from highly emphasis on speed to emphasis on quality goals. This is a very significant transform in China. So based on the macro international environment and also China's economic transitioning, we think that in the future the markets will continue to experience high volatility. And then how this is going to impact our business and as such, macro backdrop, I'd like to share my understanding with you for our five of the products as well as the opportunities we see, and that is the market conditions.",
        "And as you know that we have five products in mind, including spot commodities and securities services. Under the spot commodities, we have spot gold commodities and futures gold commodities. And then under the category of securities services, we have three products, including securities advisory services, asset management businesses and overseas securities brokerage services. So, as you can see, that among five of our product lines, four of them are transaction based business. So that means we will be impacted by the market dynamics. But then, we don't think that the high volatility or the dynamics of the market is a negative price or the risk to our company.",
        "Instead, we see more opportunities than the risk, because, if you look at our spot commodities, investors, especially our investor can treat both China and overseas commodities products. So the investors can see some market opportunities to long and short. So under the various market conditions, investors in long as in short the spot commodities and also the overseas securities. Well, various in the four [Phonetic] market, investors can definitely long and they will benefit to our securities advisory services. So nevertheless, of the market dynamic, we will see the opportunities. We will guide our clients to seize the opportunities. And why we can do that, because as we introduced, we have established 3,000 employee team in the company and we have a flexible business model that we can accommodate the market conditions to flexibly deploy our resources among the five product lines to take advantage of the market dynamics, to seize the opportunity and to guide our investors based on the market conditions to gain profit on their assets and investments. So we can, definitely elaborate the market conditions to make the greatest of profit for both our investors and the company.",
        "And I think the next question is for Mr. Qian, about our expenses outlook.",
        "Raphael Qian -- Chief Financial Officer",
        "Okay. Now, I will help to answer your second question. As you have seen, net commissions and fees from our core business have increased over 40% on a year-over-year basis, as well as our total cost increase just only 4%. Obviously, the personnel cost occupies a major part of our total cost. However, in this quarter, the personnel costs increased by only 5% on year-over-year basis. The main reason is that the number of our staff has become stable since the end of Q1. And we have set a relatively flexible or dynamic strategy to transfer our focus of internal resources among these five product lines to cope in with the highly uncertainty in the local and the global market .",
        "And we have taken a number of measures to control the personnel cost which will show a slow increase in the next few months. We believe we could achieve a considerable growth in our core revenue without a great increase in the number of staff. This will help lower the cost of revenue ratio and eventually contribute to the net profit margins.",
        "Yvonne Young -- Investor Relations Director",
        "Sorry -- James. James are your online.",

        "Yvonne Young -- Investor Relations Director",

And his question is that congratulations for the company for a brief quarter for both Q1 and Q2 and also the company give us strong guidance for Q3 and he would like to know the revenue mix for Q3 for our core business and how the companies -- how the outlook for this five products going forward.

The commodities contributed RMB174.8 million and then the security services contributed to RMB134.2 million revenues. As per Q3, we guided RMB380 million to RMB400 million. We do not give a specific revenue mix for our five product lines. But I can shed some color on the fleet amounted to product lines.

        "I would translate into English first. So this question coming from Jay Wong from Industrial Securities. His question is about the earnings outlook, because Mr. Chen mentioned in his remarks that we nearly achieved a breakeven for our core business. And he'd like to know whether the company will maintain this profitable growth in the future? Or, we see any -- how is the business trending forward?",
        "Wenbin Chen -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer",

        "Okay, let me translate.",

        "Thank you for your questions. As you can see from our Q3 guidance, that our core businesses delivered a strong growth quarter-over-quarter. And we see that -- we believe that we will maintain this trend going forward. In the second quarter if excluding the treating gains and loss, we basically, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, that achieved a breakeven for our core business. In the third quarter we think that we can make some profit from our core business slightly. And but this is not our target. We see the industry dynamics for the Asia market and the gold -- spot gold trending more favorable as we can see, we believe that the potential of our business can be truly presented, this is the first one.",
        "And secondly, even in the worst case scenario, that the market dynamics maintain, what we can see now, we think that after more than one year of investigation and also the business model discovery, of our five product lines. And also our emphasis and our continuous investment in research and improving the quality of the service to our clients, we have delivered a greater and faster growth potential of our business, relative to our peer companies. So we think that this year or 2019 is still a year for preparation for the favorable market conditions we anticipate, and the next year, we think that we can gradually deliver the revenue scale, we expect.",
        "And then the third point is that we think that the five product lines we target have a promising future and these are the niche business areas we covered are different from some other areas which have high competition. And the focus for our company next is to serve better of our clients. As I have introduced that in my remarks, and just now, and to satisfy our clients, to make our clients, to keep our high retention rate for our clients. And if we can achieve this, I don't think the top line growth and bottom line earnings is a question to us, because we have accumulated years of experience and competitive advantage which are clear to see to our peers and also our team.

      "text": [
        "Waste Management (NYSE: WM) has kept investors happy in recent years. The trash services provider's shares have climbed over 150% in the last five years and have quadrupled over the last 10, powered by a robust dividend and a strong market share - not to mention a historically strong bull market. But will the company be able to maintain this performance in a market downturn? Although recessions pose a challenge for all companies, Waste Management's industry, competitive positioning, and growing dividend positions the company to outperform the market during a recession.",
        "Image Source: Getty Images",
        "Historically, the trash service industry has been a stable and resilient. Two key reasons for this stability are the oligopoly characteristics of the trash services market and trash removal's positioning as a necessary service.",
        "The trash industry in the United States operates as an oligopoly, with only a few main competitors dominating the market. Industries that experience oligopoly competition tend to be recession-resilient because the reduced competition in these industries allow businesses more freedom to raise prices without losing market share. Trash services operates as an oligopoly primarily because of high barriers to entry due to extensive regulation surrounding landfill construction and maintenance, which makes it difficult and expensive for new landfills to be built. As a result, trash services providers are positioned to be able to control prices during an economic downturn.",
        "Industries that provide necessary services are also often recession resistant because people cannot reduce their consumption in response to economic events. Trash services checks that box perfectly. Are you going to let trash pile up in your house when the economy slows? This trait, combined with the oligopoly nature of the industry, allows trash services providers to maintain revenues during downturns and, if necessary, increase prices.",
        "Waste Management is the industry leader in trash services. In the two crucial segments in the trash services industry, collection and landfill, Waste Management enjoys a market share of 30% and 47% respectively. This compares favorably to its main competitor, Republic Services (NYSE: RSG) , who enjoys market share in collection and landfill of 24% and 17%, respectively.",
        "Waste Management's fleet includes nearly 26,000 collection and transfer vehicles, making it the largest trucking fleet in the waste industry.",
        "Waste Management also holds an advantage in landfills, owning over 100 more than Republic Services. Owning the most landfills is a huge competitive advantage because regulation and permits around building new landfills have increased so much that it is extremely difficult to build new ones.",
        "Data Source: Waste Management",
        "Waste Management performance during the great recession is the last key reason to invest in it for the coming downturn. \\Waste Management did feel the effects of the great recession but was able to return to pre-recession stock levels by April of 2011. Compare this to the S&P 500, which took until March 2012 to return to pre-market levels.",
        "WM data by YCharts",
        "Although margins dipped slightly from 2010 to 2012, Waste Management was able to maintain profitability and relatively stable free cash flows After returning to pre-recession levels, Waste Management also started to pay a dividend in 2011 and has increased that dividend by 44% since.",
        "Data source: Waste Management, Chart created by author",
        "A dividend-yielding stock is a great thing to have in a recession because the dividend yield can provide a stable rate of return as stock prices fluctuate. However, as an investor, you need to know if the dividend is affordable for the company so it can continue to pay a dividend even when revenue and profits begin to decrease. One way of determining the affordability of a dividend is by analyzing the dividend payout ratio, which measures the fraction of net income that a company pays out to shareholders as dividends. Waste Management has a 42% dividend payout ratio. This means that for every dollar of net income, Waste Management still has 58 cents left to reinvest in the business after paying its dividend. As a result, Waste Management appears well-positioned to maintain its dividend, even if a recession were to significantly reduce its earnings.",
        "Trash services is a strong recession resilient industry, and Waste Management is the largest and most competitively positioned trash service provider. With Waste Management's competitive dominance, coupled with its steady and affordable dividend yield, it is the perfect recession-proof stock to invest in.",

        "Once heralded as a leap forward in convenience and security, adoption of mobile payment services in the U.S. is still relatively underwhelming compared to other countries, even as the U.S. boasts high levels of smartphone adoption. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is hoping that its new Apple Card can help nudge adoption higher, offering a higher rewards rate of 2% cash back for purchases made using Apple Pay, compared to the standard 1% cash back when using the titanium card. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google rebranded its service as Google Pay in early 2018, combining Google Wallet and Android Pay.",
        "Here's why America has been slow to jump on the mobile payments bandwagon.",
        "Apple really wants Apple Card to bolster Apple Pay usage. Image source: Apple.",
        "CNBC reports that mobile payments adoption in the U.S. remains under 10%, according to recent estimates from Bain. One key reason is that mobile payments are only negligibly more convenient than using regular credit or debit cards. Swiping a plastic card is already incredibly fast, and in some cases can be even easier than using Apple Pay, which requires the user to authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID and confirm the transaction with several button presses.",
        "The credit card ecosystem in the U.S. is very mature with 80% adoption. Outside of traditional payment methods, PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) enjoys strong adoption of 44%. At 9%, Apple Pay does have the highest adoption rate among mobile payment services, but that level of usage is still less than ideal. PayPal's Venmo comes in second among mobile payment offerings at 7%, with Zelle and Google offerings each at 6%, according to the report.",
        "\"Based on June quarter performance, Apple Pay is now adding more new users than PayPal, and monthly transaction volume is growing four times as fast,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook bragged\u00a0a month ago. That's somewhat of a specious comparison, though, as PayPal has been around for two decades and Apple Pay is growing off an extremely small user base. Apple Pay now conducts 1 billion transactions per month, Cook added.",
        "Other countries that are seeing higher rates of mobile payment adoption, such as China and India, are coming from cash-based economies, according to Bain. Mobile payments do represent a significant improvement in convenience and security over cash. India has\u00a0been waging a war on cash in recent years, while Chinese tech giants like Tencent and Alibaba have made their respective mobile payment services the preferred payment methods among consumers.",
        "Additionally, Americans love credit card rewards programs, and mobile payment services aren't as generous. While Apple Card offers 2% on Apple Pay transactions, Goldman Sachs estimates that most users will end up earning close to 1% cash back on average from using the physical card.",
        "The opportunity for Apple Pay in the U.S. might not be that great, which is why the company has been aggressively expanding in other countries. The tech giant launched Apple Pay in 17 countries last quarter, bringing its total to 47 markets.",

Not exactly the scorecard investors wanted to see heading into the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.",
        "Despite the short-term hiccup, Old Navy remains the best of this apparel bunch, and its upcoming stock spin-off (after which Old Navy will be free to operate as it pleases) doesn't bode well for the leftover pieces. The Gap, which is now officially what everything besides Old Navy will be called post-break-up, could be in real trouble.",
        "Gap's stock is plumbing lows not seen since 2011, and it's easy to see why. Revenues have been stagnant the last few years, and trailing 12-month free cash flow (basic profits after operating expenses and capital expenditures are subtracted) has plummeted 68% over the last five years.",
        "The reason? Comparable store sales -- a blend of number of customers making a purchase and average ticket size -- at The Gap's largest names have been in steep decline. The shopping mall locations are suffering from lower foot traffic and e-commerce competition, including online-only stores. The only reason Gap's total revenue isn't in all-out decline is that it's opening new locations, particularly in fast-developing Asia.",

        "Shares of Ambarella (NASDAQ: AMBA) were up 16.5% as of noon EDT Friday, after the video-processing chip specialist announced stronger-than-expected quarterly results .",
        "More specifically for its fiscal second quarter ended July 31, Ambarella's quarterly revenue declined 9.7% year over year to $56.4 million, though it was still above the high end of guidance for a range of $51 million to $53 million. On the bottom line, that translated to adjusted net income of $7.3 million, or $0.21 per share -- down from $0.25 per share a year earlier, but absolutely crushing estimates of $0.02 per share.",
        "IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.",
        "Ambarella CEO Fermi Wang noted the company began mass-production shipments of computer-vision systems on a chip (CV SoCs) into the automotive market this quarter, and made \"strong progress\" toward its vision for transitioning \"from a pure video processing company to an artificial intelligence video company.\"",
        "Wang added that Ambarella's confidence has increased in its full fiscal-year outlook -- which includes seeing revenue in the second half climbing relative to the first half -- in spite of geopolitical uncertainty.",
        "In the meantime, Ambarella expects fiscal third-quarter revenue to be between $63 million and $67 million, significantly above consensus estimates for revenue closer to $55.4 million.",
        "Put simply, this was a straightforward quarterly beat followed by strong forward guidance. And even with shares of this tech leader up more than 30% year to date leading up to this report, it's hardly surprising to see Ambarella stock soaring in response.",

      "text": [
        "By Felix Tam and Twinnie Siu",
        "HONG KONG, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Hong Kong police arrested a number of prominent pro-democracy activists including Joshua Wong and three lawmakers on Friday, seeking to rein in protests that have plunged the city into its worst political crisis for decades.",
        "Wong, who was one of the leaders of the pro-democracy \"Umbrella\" movement five years ago, is the most prominent activist to be arrested since protests escalated in mid-June over fears China is exerting greater control over the city and squeezing its freedoms.",
        "Police also arrested Agnes Chow, another senior member of his group Demosisto.",
        "Other activists arrested included Athea Suen, a former university student union leader, as well as three pro-democracy lawmakers - Cheng Chung-tai, Au Nok-him and Jeremy Tam.",
        "Au and Tam had been present at some protests and faced charges including obstructing police officers, according to their political parties.",
        "Police also blocked plans for a mass demonstration on Saturday in a show of force a day before the fifth anniversary of a decision by China to curtail democratic reforms in the former British colony.",
        "The bespectacled Wong, who was 17 when he became the face of the student-led civil disobedience movement in 2014 that blocked major roads for 79 days, has not been a prominent figure in the latest protests, which have no identifiable leaders.",
        "He was released from jail in June after serving a five-week term for contempt of court.",
        "Wong and Chow were released on bail and the case was adjourned until Nov. 8, but they will be subject to travel restrictions and a night-time curfew.",
        "\"Under the chilling effects generated by Beijing and Hong Kong governments, we are strongly aware how they arrest activists no matter whether they behave progressively or moderately,\" Wong told reporters.",
        "\"All we ask for is just to urge Beijing and Hong Kong governments to withdraw the bill, stop police brutality and respond to our calls for a free election.\"",
        "Thousands of demonstrators blockaded police headquarters on June 21 protesting against a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. ",
        "More than three months of unrest has evolved into calls for greater democracy under the \"one country, two systems\" formula, by which Hong Kong has been ruled since the handover from British rule in 1997. The formula guaranteed freedoms not enjoyed on mainland China.",
        "Protesters accuse China of interference that they say has  steadily eroded Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy. ",
        "China denies the accusation. It has denounced the protests and warned of the damage to the economy of Hong Kong, a major financial centre.",
        "It has also accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the demonstrations and warned against foreign interference.",
        "MISJUDGEMENT?",
        "Andy Chan, a founder of the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party that was banned last September, was arrested at Hong Kong airport on Thursday on suspicion of participating in riots and attacking police, police said.",
        "Wong's pro-democracy group, Demosisto, said the arrests were an attempt to scapegoat individuals in a movement that has built momentum without public figureheads.",
        "\"The arrests were apparently a political operation,\" Demosisto said on its Facebook page. \"It will only make the government misjudge the public, leading to a deadly situation that is more difficult to resolve.\"",
        "The Civil Human Rights Front, the organiser of previous protests, cancelled a mass demonstration planned for Saturday after the police refused permission.",
        "Reuters exclusively reported on Friday that Chief Executive Carrie Lam previously requested Beijing's approval for a plan to ease tension, evidence of the extent to which China is controlling the Hong Kong government's response to the unrest. ",
        "Nearly 900 people have been arrested since the demonstrations began. There have been frequent clashes between protesters and police, who have often used fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds, amid accusations of excessive force.",
        "With protesters and authorities locked in an impasse and Hong Kong facing its first recession in a decade, speculation has grown that the city government may impose emergency law, giving it extra powers over detentions, censorship and curfews.",
        "Hong Kong's July retail sales sank the most since February 2016, government data showed on Friday. ",
        "The government would consider using \"all laws\" to prevent violence, Hong Kong leader Lam, who has become a lightning rod for protesters' anger, said this week.",
        "Hong Kong was a long way from having to make use of emergency powers, a senior official of China's parliament told Reuters on Friday. ",
        "China brought fresh troops into Hong Kong on Thursday in what it said was a routine rotation of its garrison. "

      "title": "Amazon (AMZN): America's Golden Child Ripens - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        " FAANG, as an aggregate, has been underperforming the broader market over the past 52-weeks with only one stock illustrating positive returns. Over the past 12 months, Netflix NFLX  shares lost 19.4%, Amazon AMZN  is down 10.5%, Apple AAPL  shares fell 7.7%, and Alphabet GOOGL  is down 4.7%. Facebook FB  , the one bright spot in FAANG, has been able to return shareholders 3.9% in the last 52-weeks. Is this signaling a buying opportunity or a sign to get out while you still have your dignity?  The Golden Child  America's sweetheart stock, Amazon, has given investors a wild ride over the last year. From AMZN's all-time high of $2,050 in the beginning of September last year the stock dropped over 36% going into the new year. It has recovered quite a bit since Christmas Eve's lows, rallying over 35% to $1,773. This is still 13.5% off its 52-week highs.    Amazon has come a long way from Bezo's garage-based book store. It now operating not only the largest ecommerce business in the world, but also controls a majority share in the cloud computing market with its early penetration. Since Bezo's originally took Amazon public in 1997, its stock price has proliferated over 100,000% because of Amazon's innate ability to perpetually stay ahead of the curve. AMZN has a buy rating across the board and is sporting a short interest below 1%, making it one of the least shorted equities in the market. Does this mean that AMZN is an unstoppable power that has no where to go but up, or is this a sign that this stock may have too much optimistic market sentiment and investors have traded it above and beyond its intrinsic value? Amazon shares are trading at 57.8 times 12-month forward earnings. This is substantially higher than the S&P 500's 17x, which means that AMZN has an extraordinary amount of growth priced into it. It might not take a big economic down side to see its valuations shrink.  Q2 Results  Amazon has fallen over 10% since its earnings release on the 25 th  of July but is still up 16% for the year. The company beat sales expectations but missed on EPS for the first time in 2 years, inducing shareholder concern. Amazon's cloud segment, AWS, also missed estimates, decelerating the growth of this segment quicker than expected. AWS is anticipated to be the primary growth driver moving forward. This larger than expected slowdown caused uneasy AMZN sentiment in the market. Amazon has been struggling with short term costs due to its investment in one-day delivery domestically and internationally. Analysts are anticipating that Amazon's high margin AWS cloud business will make up for the thinning margins in e-commerce. 70 to 80% of operating income is expected to be derived from AWS by the end of this year. Prime Day was an enormous success and the single largest event in Amazon history with sales surpassing Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. Expect the benefits of this event to be reaped in Q3. I believe that these short-term margin cuts will not affect the long-term growth of the company, and as AMZN's price falls, the buying opportunity ripens. The question is what price makes these shares a truly ripe buy? The price at which I would not hesitate to pull the trigger on AMZN is anything below $1,500.  Same Day Delivery Issues  Amazon is attempting to take its incredibly fast and efficient ecommerce offering to the next level with same-day and one-day delivery. This is something that would be considered unprecedented in the past and something that delivery services like FedEx FDX  or UPS UPS  would never have thought was possible. Amazon cut ties with FedEx in early August and has not looked back with their own delivery services having grown leaps and bounds over the past 5 years. Since the end of 2013, Amazon has increased the number of fulfillment centers and internal distribution extensively to accommodate its shortened deliver services. Same-day delivery options makes the choice between going to the store and ordering from your couch a much easier decision. The number of prime subscribers has spiked to over 100 million in the US according to WSJ article, almost one third of the total population in America. Amazon's expediated deliveries came at a price though. The cost shipping and fulfillment costs significantly increased pinching the firms operating margins. Long-term, the company hopes that this new service will drive topline growth back into acceleration and the scale will improve margins.  Take Away  Amazon is America's favorite online retailer and ostensibly their favorite stock. I believe that its current price is a good reflection of its current value with the trade war instigating concerns over a looming economic slowdown. AMZN remains a strong long-term investment with its diverse portfolio of market leading businesses. As a short-term investment, I may wait to see this stock tumble a little more before I feel comfortable putting a position on. The lower it goes the more attractive the buy, and I would not hesitate to buy if it crosses under the $1,500 market and continue to average down slowly if it continues to drop. Never put a huge position on a falling stock, instead hedge your bets with small positions as it falls. If you are going to catch a falling knife, make sure you do it with a glove.

      "text": [
        "Shares of cloud-computing specialist Fastly (NYSE: FSLY) fell sharply on Thursday, declining 12.5% by the time the market closed. The stock was likely simply taking a natural pause after an astounding 115% run-up between Aug. 14 and Aug. 28.",
        "Shares rose again on Friday, up more than 13% at 3:40 p.m.",
        "Here's what investors should know about all this volatility.",
        "Since Fastly went public earlier this year, the stock has been on a roller-coaster ride. After gaining 50% on its first day of trading in May, it failed to gain more traction leading up to Fastly's inaugural quarterly update as a publicly traded business. After the report, shares initially pulled back.",
        "Image source: Getty Images.",
        "But analyst upgrades for the tech stock following the Aug. 8 earnings release reversed the market sentiment, and shares proceeded to skyrocket. Following this 115% run-up, the stock was hit with a 12.5% decline on Thursday -- a natural cooling-off period for shares on such a torrid upward march. But shares are climbing higher again on Friday, rising about 8% as of 12:37 p.m. EDT.",
        "There's an argument that much of the stock's wild volatility is the result of the dwindling supply of Fastly shares, as one investment firm -- Abdiel -- has been gobbling them up, reducing Fastly's total float by about 29%. Furthermore, after such big gains for the stock, some investors could be on edge due to fears it could come back down after a lock-up period for insiders expires in November.",
        "Investors, of course, should remain focused on the company's fundamentals and the stock's valuation. Shares are significantly more expensive today than they were a few months ago. But Fastly is notably growing at a solid rate, with second-quarter revenue up 34% year over year. The company also boasts an impressive dollar-based net expansion rate of 132%, highlighting how existing customers are ramping up their spending with Fastly.",

        "It's been a tough year for NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) . Shares are down 44% since October, and adjusted earnings slid 36% year-over-year in the second quarter, which beat Wall Street expectations.",
        "Despite those dismal numbers, there are signs the maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) may be turning around. The one-time Wall Street highflier, whose stock surged more than 900% from the beginning of 2016 to October 2018, is putting the disastrous effects of the cryptocurrency crash behind it.",
        "Image Source: Getty Images",
        "In its most recen t earnings , NVIDIA showed sequential growth in all five revenue segments; strength in gaming was fueled by ray tracing technology and notebook sales; and data centers returned to sequential growth for the first time in nine months. Let's take a closer look.",
        "NVIDIA produces GPUs that can be used for a variety of computing purposes, including artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles, big data processing, video games, and, notably, cryptocurrency mining.",
        "When the crypto currency market was booming, so was NVIDIA's growth. As crypto prices soared, and interest in crypto mining grew, demand surged as do-it-yourself miners rushed out to buy GPUs, including NVIDIA's, to build their own mining rigs, but when crypto values collapsed, so did demand for graphics cards.",
        "Misjudging the market, management had produced GPUs to meet demand that had vanished. As inventory swelled in sales channels, NVIDIA slashed prices and delayed shipments. Revenues and profits plummeted, but management tried to reassure investors it was only a short-term problem. Was it?",
        "Fast forward nine months to Aug. 15, when NVIDIA released second-quarter earnings. Although the numbers were expectedly bad on a year-over-year basis -- revenue down 17% and adjusted earnings down 36% -- they were better than analysts forecasts. Adjusted EPS was $1.24, which was $0.10 above Wall Street expectations. Total revenue was $2.6 billion, a 16% improvement over the previous quarter's $2.2 billion.",

Less than a week later, Microsoft and NVIDIA jointly announced that Minecraft -- one of the most popular games of all time -- would soon support ray tracing.",

        "Huang said notebook sales \"have grown significantly\" year-over-year, and he expected that growth to continue into next year.",
        "With gaming typically producing more than half of NVIDIA's revenue, the improved second-quarter numbers were an encouraging sign for shareholders.",
        "Data centers account for about 25% of NVIDIA's total revenue, but signs last year of slowing growth were a concern even before the cryptocurrency bust.",
        "Although the most recent quarter's data center revenue ($655 million) was down 14% year-over-year, there was a positive. It increased sequentially, albeit a tepid 3.3%.",
        "Chart created by author; Data source: NVIDIA",
        "NVIDIA's goal is to tap into the enormous emerging markets of artificial intelligence. Data centers are connected computer servers, and those servers can number in the thousands for some companies, storing and processing massive amounts of information. NVIDIA's GPUs provide servers the power needed to speed up those processes, including artificial intelligence.",
        "Huang said the company is well positioned in what is likely the most important application -- conversational AI, the use of messaging apps, chatbots, or voice assistants to simulate real conversations. (In a 2018 report , Juniper Research estimated that 8 billion digital voice assistants would be in use by 2023, more than tripling the number estimated by the digital technology consultant for the end of 2018.)",
        "Huang said the company was seeing growth among industries adopting AI to improve efficiency, \"whether it's a delivery robot or some kind of a chatbot or the ability to detect fraud in financial services.\"",
        "Investors are banking on NVIDIA's data center growth, and the second quarter provides at least cautious optimism that may be happening.",
        "Looking ahead",
        "NVIDIA's growth opportunities are undeniable, even in light of possible short-term headwinds. A trade war with China, where NVIDIA does business, has stoked fears of a recession. That's important to consider, but it's also important to remember those are short-term concerns.",
        "Longer term, there will be growing demand to power computing for artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and analysis of big data. NVIDIA can capitalize on that. After a quarter that showed signs of returning growth, it could be time for long-term investors to take a closer look.",
        "10 stocks we like better than NVIDIA\r\n When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has quadrupled the market.*",
        "David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and NVIDIA wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.",

      "title": "5 Recession Resistant Stocks to Buy for Protection - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips",
        "Seemingly everywhere you look, there are signs of a recession. The yield curve is inverted. There are negative interest rates everywhere across the globe. The 30-Year Treasury yield is at an all-time low. The U.S.-China trade war is escalating. Manufacturing activity globally is slowing. Corporate insiders are selling stock in bulk. Business confidence is eroding.",
        "To be sure, I think a lot of this recession chatter is noise, and that most - if not all - of those \"indicators\" are red herrings. My base case scenario today remains for the U.S. economy to stay in expansion mode for the next 12 months, and for the S&P 500 to grind higher.",
        "Still, one cannot ignore all those dour signs, and it may be smart to at least start preparing for the worst. As the old saying goes: prepare for the worst, hope for the best.",
        "In the investment world, how does one prepare for a recession? It's simple. Buy safe stocks with a track record of recession resistance.",
        "Those stocks are tough to find. Most stocks don't make the cut. Instead, most stocks plunge alongside the market during recessions. But, a few don't, and the few that don't are the ones that should be on your \"prepare for the worst\" radar.",
        "Which stocks make the cut? Let's take a look at five safe stocks to buy with recession resistance.",
        "Alpha Generated in Last Recession:\u00a0 58%",
        "Why: Consumers migrate to discount retailers when money becomes tight.",
        "The Thesis: The bull thesis on Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) as a safe stock to buy in a recession is pretty simple.",
        "Recessions hurt the U.S. consumer - they don't outright kill U.S. consumption. As such, consumers still shop during recessions because they still need things like food, clothes and other essentials. The only difference in a recession is that they are doing this \"essentials\" shopping at discount retailers. Walmart is the king of the discount retail segment. Thus, when times get tough, consumers flock to Walmart to save money on their \"essentials\" shopping.",
        "The result? Walmart's numbers can actually improve during a recession, and WMT stock can actually move higher. Just look at the last recession. The S&P 500 peaked in October 2007, and bottomed in November 2009. During that stretch, the index lost about 56.5%. WMT stock gained 1.5% over that same stretch, thereby generating 58 percentage points of alpha over the market during the last recession.",
        "Could the same thing happen during the next recession? Yes. And it probably will, given that Walmart has only extended its dominance in the discount retail game.",
        "Alpha Generated in Last Recession:\u00a0 50%",
        "Why: Consumers buy cheap food when money becomes tight.",
        "The Thesis:\u00a0 Much like the bull thesis on Walmart, the recession-proof bull thesis on McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) is similarly simple.",
        "During recessions, most people keep their jobs - the unemployment rate jumped to just 10% in the last recession. Wage gains fall flat, but consumers are still making incomes. Thus, in a recession, consumers don't all become unemployed and broke - instead, most actually remain income-earners. That income just becomes tighter. When it becomes tighter, consumers start to look to cut down their expenses wherever they can.",
        "One place to do so is on food. Consumers still have to eat. But, they don't have to eat as expensively. The real world translation? During a recession, McDonald's dollar menu starts to look a lot tastier.",
        "That's why McDonald's can actually get a boost during a recession, and why MCD stock can generate tremendous alpha. While the market plunged more than 56% from late 2007 to early 2009, MCD stock fell just 7%. That represents an impressive near 50 percentage points of alpha during the last recession.",
        "Will such out-performance happen again? Yes. McDonald's has widened its lead in the discount QSR segment since 2007, and in so doing, it has become an even safer bet during a recession than a decade ago.",
        "Alpha Generated in Last Recession:\u00a0 N/A",
        "Why: Consumers still want to work out, but don't want to spend as much on gym memberships.",
        "The Thesis:\u00a0 Although there is no stock performance data to back the recession-proof thesis on Planet Fitness (NASDAQ: PLNT ) - the stock wasn't public during the last recession - the bull thesis on why this stock should generate big alpha during an economic slowdown is nonetheless compelling.",
        "Now, more-so than ever before, consumers want to workout, look good and live a healthy lifestyle. Doing so comes with added costs, such as gym memberships. Those aren't cheap. Gym memberships can cost anywhere from $40 a month, to several hundred dollars per month. But, Planet Fitness offers gym memberships for as low as $10 per month.",
        "In an economic slowdown, consumers still want to workout, look good and live a healthy lifestyle. They just want to do it for less. How do they accomplish that? By canceling their 24 Hour or LA Fitness gym memberships and signing up for Planet Fitness.",
        "How many people will do this? Not a lot. But, enough to where Planet Fitness' numbers could actually improve during a recession, meaning that PLNT stock could actually move higher against a plunging market.",
        "Alpha Generated in Last Recession:\u00a0 55%",
        "Why: Consumers always need to eat, regardless of the economic backdrop.",
        "The Thesis:\u00a0 When it comes to Flower Foods (NYSE: FLO ), the bull thesis behind why to buy this stock in a recession is very straightforward.",
        "Consumers always need to eat. But, during a recession, they become more selective about what they eat. That is, they cut back on the filet mignon, and bulk up on low-cost baked goods. Flower Foods is the second largest producer of packaged baked goods in the country, owning popular brands such as Nature's Own and Wonder Bread . As such, this company actually gets a tailwind when the economy slows, because more consumers pivot into buying their low-cost baked goods.",
        "The proof is in the numbers. During the last recession, the market plunged more than 56%. Over the same stretch that the market lost more than half of its value, FLO stock dropped less than a percent. That's right - less than a percent. At the same time, FLO stock paid shareholders a 2% dividend yield.",
        "Can this huge out-performance repeat itself during the next recession? I don't see why not. All the fundamentals are the same, and FLO stock has a 3%-plus dividend yield now.",
        "Alpha Generated in Last Recession:\u00a0 58%",
        "Why: When money becomes tight, consumers stop shopping at full-price retail stores and start shopping at off-price retail stores.",
        "The Thesis:\u00a0 When it comes to Ross Stores (NASDAQ: ROST ), the bull thesis on why to buy ROST stock during a recession is a slight iteration of the WMT recession-proof bull thesis.",
        "That is, during tough economic times, money becomes tight. But, consumers still need to live, so they still need to buy things like food, clothes, so on and so forth. In a recession, they just migrate all that shopping from full-price stores to off-price stores. Ross Stores owns two of those off-price stores - Ross Dress for Less and dd's Discounts.",
        "Those stores did quite well during the last recession. Comparable store sales at Ross Stores rose 1% in 2007, then accelerated to 2% growth in 2008 and 6% growth in 2009. So, not only did Ross Stores hold up during the last recession, the company's growth trajectory actually accelerated - likely thanks to the aforementioned consumption shift from full-price to off-price.",
        "ROST stock reflected this out-performance. From late 2007 to early 2009, while the market shed more than half of its value, ROST stock rose nearly 2%.",
        "This same out-performance should repeat come the next recession, mostly because Ross Stores remains one of the very few big brand names in the discount retail segment, and thus, will benefit from the broad full-price to off-price consumption shift.",

      "text": [
        "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips",
        "With Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) facing not one, but two huge legal threats that could cripple the company, shorting JNJ stock now seems like a good idea.",
        "Moreover, despite these two huge threats, the valuation of JNJ stock remains fairly elevated. Specifically, its trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 21 is almost exactly in line with the market average.",
        "\"In 2018, a jury awarded a nearly $4.7 billion verdict to 22 women and their families who claimed that asbestos in JNJ's talcum powder had contributed to their ovarian cancer,\" I wrote in July. \"The company is appealing the lawsuit.\"",
        "JNJ is now facing 14,000 \"similar cases,\" medtruthreported earlier this month . The publication added that a single federal judge could dismiss all but 2,000 of those lawsuits. Still, if the 2,000 remaining plaintiffs win an average of $50 million, that's a total of $100 billion, and probably too much for J&J to afford. Additionally, the judge's verdict could be appealed.",
        "On Monday, a judge ordered J&J to pay Oklahoma $572 million after finding that the company had used deceptive marketing practices to push its opioids. Johnson & Johnson says it will appeal the verdict. The company is one of the defendants in a class-action federal lawsuit that involves about 2,000 plaintiffs. Separately, dozens of states have filed lawsuits against companies involved with selling opioid drugs. Presumably, J&J is a defendant in at least some of those lawsuits.",
        "The Oklahoma verdict will have a negative impact on J&J's ability to defend itself outside of the state, although it doesn't mean that the other cases have become a slam dunk, Stanford University Law professor Nora Freeman Engstrom told USA Today.",
        "With a population of around 4 million, Oklahoma is definitely not a large state, yet it was awarded (pending appeal) nearly $600 million from J&J. With Johnson & Johnson facing lawsuits from hundreds of other plaintiffs at the federal level - and likely from multiple larger states - the company could easily wind up being forced to pay $75 billion.",
        "Some pundits and journalists have pointed to the company's huge profits as evidence of its invincibility. But at the end of the second quarter, the company only listed $15.3 billion of cash on its balance sheet. And it listed over $30 billion of debt.",
        "Let's say the company has to pay, in total, $150 billion as a result of the talcum and opioid suits. Let's also assume that insurance pays half of that total, leaving the company with a total liability of $75 billion. Its total net debt would be about $90 billion, assuming its debt and cash levels remain constant before its total legal liabilities are determined. That would probably be too much\u00a0 for it to handle without at least selling more shares of stock, considering that the total market cap of JNJ is about $340 billion. Moreover, the negative publicity could hurt the company with consumers, Medicare and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, potentially denting its quarterly financial results.",
        "Despite the fact that JNJ is facing massive potential liabilities on two fronts, JNJ stock is trading as though nothing is wrong. Unless JNJ miraculously finds a cure for an extremely widespread, debilitating disease, JNJ stock will not climb meaningfully for at least a year.",
        "If, however, more court cases start to go against JNJ, and the credit-rating agencies warn that its balance sheet doesn't look so good, JNJ stock will start to rapidly fall and it will have to cut its dividend. I would put the chances of that scenario happening at about 65%. And I think there's about a 20% chance that it will go bankrupt and a 50% chance that it will have to\u00a0 issue many more shares of JNJ stock.",
        "When it comes to shorting stocks, the risk/reward ratio doesn't doesn't get much better than the one that Johnson & Johnson is currently presenting.",
        "As of this writing, Larry Ramer did not own shares of any of the aforementioned securities.",

        "Over the past 12 months, Baidu's stock plunged more than 50% as Alibaba's stayed nearly flat. Baidu fell out of favor because its core advertising business was slammed by the trade war, economic slowdown in China, and competition from rival platforms.",
        "Image source: Getty Images.",
        "Meanwhile, Alibaba's growth remained robust as Chinese consumers continued buying products online and enterprise customers kept signing up for its cloud services. Based on those facts, Alibaba seems like a safer investment than Baidu -- but will those trends continue over the next few quarters?",
        "Baidu generated 73% of its revenue from online ads last quarter . The rest of its revenue mainly comes from its video streaming platform iQiyi (NASDAQ: IQ) , cloud services, and smart speakers and screens. Baidu spun off iQiyi in an IPO last year, but it retains a majority stake in the company and covers some of its content costs.",
        "The growth of Baidu's online ad business ground to a halt in the first half of 2019, but iQiyi's growth kept its total revenue growth in positive territory. However, Baidu's growing dependence on iQiyi is a double-edged sword, since iQiyi's unprofitable and capital-intensive business weighs down its earnings.",
        "Alibaba's core commerce business generated 87% of its\u00a0revenue last quarter . The unit houses Taobao (a consumer-to-consumer platform), Tmall (a business-to-consumer platform), Alibaba.com (a business-to-business platform), and AliExpress (for overseas shoppers), as well as brick-and-mortar stores and a majority stake in Southeast Asian e-commerce giant Lazada.",
        "The rest of Alibaba's revenue comes from its cloud, digital entertainment, and innovation initiatives units. None of those businesses are profitable, so Alibaba leverages the growth of its profitable core commerce business to expand those smaller units, which widens its moat against Baidu, Tencent (OTC: TCEHY) , and other rivals.",
        "Baidu's biggest problem is its advertising business. Its ad revenue fell 9% annually last quarter, due to lower ad spending from companies and competition from rivals like ByteDance and Tencent's WeChat.",
        "That decline was offset by the 44% growth of Baidu's \"other\" businesses (mainly iQiyi, Baidu Cloud, and smart speakers), but its total revenue rose just 1% annually. Baidu's weak ad growth and its growing dependence on lower-margin businesses caused its adjusted operating margin to plummet 18 percentage points annually to 7% during the quarter as its adjusted net income plummeted 53%.",
        "Image source: Getty Images.",
        "Alibaba's business, however, was firing on all cylinders last quarter. Its core commerce revenue rose 44% annually, fueled by robust demand for fast-moving consumer goods, apparel, consumer electronics, and home furnishings, which indicated that China's economic slowdown wasn't hurting the average shopper.",
        "Its other businesses were also healthy -- its cloud revenue surged 66%, its digital media revenue grew 6%, and its innovation initiatives revenue rose 21%. None of those businesses generated a profit, but the strong growth of Alibaba's core commerce business offset their losses. As a result, Alibaba's total revenue rose 42% annually, its operating margin expanded from 10% to 21%, and its adjusted net income jumped 54%.",
        "Baidu expects its revenue to fall 1% annually during the third quarter. It didn't provide any bottom line guidance, but\u00a0analysts expect a 53% decline. They also expect its revenue and earnings to decline 1% and 54%, respectively, for the full year.",
        "Alibaba didn't provide any guidance, but Wall Street expects its revenue and\u00a0earnings to rise 32% and 23%, respectively, for the full year. Those forecasts indicate that Alibaba is much better insulated from macro headwinds and competition than Baidu.",
        "Baidu trades at 17 times forward earnings, which is slightly lower than Alibaba's forward P/E ratio of 20. However, Baidu deserves a lower multiple due to its negative earnings growth, while Alibaba deserves a higher one since it's still clearly a growth stock .",
        "Based on those facts, Alibaba is clearly a better buy than Baidu. I own shares of Baidu, and I think it will eventually rebound as its newer initiatives (like mini programs, voice search, AI, and connected cars) kick in, but it will likely remain in the penalty box until its core advertising business improves.",
        "10 stocks we like better than Baidu\r\n When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has quadrupled the market.*",
        "David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Baidu wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.",

      "text": [
        "Have you been wondering when the next recession will hit? Seems like recession stories appear daily in the media. This should scare the bejesus out of investors who would want to position themselves for a recession. I find this emphasis on recession trash talk interesting.",
        "Let me start by saying that currently - outside of a yield curve inversion - there is no reliable short or long term indicator warning of a recession. Recession forecasting becomes more-and-more inaccurate the further out one forecasts. Six months seems to be the outside limit for a quantitative and objective forecast. Most of the recession forecasters I have read are forecasting a recession from one to two years away. These are subjective forecasts.",
        "At this point, no forward-looking quantitative economic forecast is warning of a recession. Our September economic forecast issued this week [discussed later in this post] improved modestly for the second month in a row.",
        "A recession will happen in the future at some point - this is a bettable certainty. And sooner or later a recession forecast will end up being correct.",
        "I find it interesting that there was a major economic downturn in 2016 - and there was no recession trash talk them. I am believing that the media's hatred of President Trump is influencing negative coverage of the economy. This manipulation by the press and corporate entities goes back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered by yellow journalism and the likes of\u00a0Edward Louis Bernays\u00a0whose propaganda supported World War I, convinced people Ivory Soap was superior, bacon and eggs was the best way to start the day, helped the CIA orchestrated overthrow of the Guatemalan government, and got women to smoke by branding cigarettes as feminist.",

        "The current round of recession talk should be considered propaganda.",
        "History shows that a first-term President lucky enough to have a growing economy is usually re-elected. Those who do not like President Trump need to trash the economy.",
        "No one should blame President Obama for the crappy economy he was stuck with. A good economy requires some luck (events which boost the economy), the Federal Reserve proper stewardship of monetary policy, and a Congress working on fiscal policy to boost the economy. President Obama was stuck with a Fed which never shifted out of a recession-recovery gear and a Congress which literally did nothing to boost the economy. Have things changed much under President Trump? The Federal Reserve remains behind the eight ball in interpreting inflation and economic direction whilst Congress continues to do nothing.",
        "President Trump is wrong in saying the economy is \"strong\" but a President is a cheerleader for the economy. If he said the economy was tubing, likely it would tube.",

        "By Jamie McGeever",
        "BRASILIA, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Brazil's real lost almost 8% in August, making it one of the worst-performing currencies against the dollar, behind Argentina's peso, and marking its weakest month in four years.",
        "The slide, exacerbated by market positioning, aggressive bets on lower Brazilian interest rates and a financial crisis in neighboring Argentina, took the real past 4.00 per dollar and prompted the central bank to intervene in the market.",
        "According to Refinitiv data, the real is on course for a 7.7% decline against the dollar this month, its biggest monthly fall since September 2015, when it lost 8.4% of its value.",
        "\"This month was very bad for emerging markets. We had Argentina crisis, escalation of the U.S.-China trade war, and a decent deleveraging of Brazil risk,\" said the head of Treasury trading at a bank in Sao Paulo, who requested not to be named.",
        "\"However, September may be a risk on month for Brazil,\" he added.",
        "The real started August around 3.80 per dollar , but weakened to an 11-month low of almost 4.20 this week. That took it to within touching distance of its record low around 4.25 per dollar from September, 2015, when Brazil was in the midst of one of its deepest-ever recessions.",
        "The central bank sold dollars on the spot market for the first time in over a decade, a move many observers said was a direct response to the real's fall through 4.00/$ and its failure to rebound as the all-time low around 4.25/$ approached. ",
        "Market positioning also contributed to the slide. As August started, funds trading U.S. futures markets had already unwound their large short position in the real, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed, meaning they were more likely to sell again if they saw fit.",
        "To be \"short\" an asset is to bet that its value will fall, and to be \"long\" is to bet it will rise in value."

        "Shares of Guardant Health (NASDAQ: GH) were slipping Friday after investors noticed that one of the company's independent directors sold off some shares. The medical diagnostics provider's stock was down 9.4% as of 1:10 p.m. EDT, washing away the gains produced by the exciting second-quarter earnings report it delivered earlier this month.",
        "Ian Clark was CEO of Genentech from 2010 through 2016, and now he sits on boards of a handful of companies, including Guardant Health. On Monday, Clark sold some shares of Guardant Health at $94.05 immediately after exercising an option that allowed him to acquire them for $4.18 per share.",
        "Image source: Getty Images.",
        "Clark disposed of just 538 shares, netting himself just $48,350 before taxes. That's hardly enough to raise alarms, but he also sold 9,683 shares of Guardant Health on the day of the company's second-quarter earnings call , just a few weeks ago.",
        "When it comes to interpreting insider transactions, always remember that there are endless reasons to sell a stock, but just one reason to buy. Clark probably just needed the money for back-to-school shopping or some other innocuous purpose.",
        "The reason he chose to sell significant shares of Guardant rather than of the other companies he works for looks pretty straightforward as well. Clark's also a director at Forty-Seven and Corvus Pharmaceuticals , shares of which have lost 51% and 58%, respectively, over the past year. Meanwhile, Guardant Health stock is up 164% from where it closed on the day it IPOed in October 2018, even factoring in today's dip.",
        "While it's tempting to sell stocks that are underperforming, that's a bad idea 99% of the time. And taking profits is a less insidious motivation than today's stock flop would indicate.

        "Operator",
        "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Campbell's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Ken Gosnell, Vice President, Finance Strategy and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.",
        "Ken Gosnell -- Vice President, Finance Strategy and Investor Relations",
        "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Campbell's fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2019 earnings call . As usual, we have created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find these slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media who participate in a listen-only mode.",
        "Turning to Slide 2. Today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in the appendix of this presentation.",
        "Additionally, concurrently with our filing of our 10-K in a few weeks, we plan to file an 8-K, which will recast historical quarterly and full year unaudited financial information, reflecting the discontinued operations, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the GAAP presentation.",
        "On Slide 3, you can see the agenda we will cover today. With us on the call today are Mark Clouse, Campbell's President and CEO and Anthony DiSilvestro, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will share his thoughts on our performance in the quarter, our progress in fiscal 2019 against our strategic initiatives, and provide his perspective on our outlook for fiscal '20. Then Anthony, will walk through the financial details as well as our guidance for fiscal 2020.",
        "With that, let me turn the call over to Mark.",
        "Mark A. Clouse -- President and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. This morning I will make high-level comments about our combined results for ease of comparison to our most recently provided sales and earnings guidance. Anthony will bridge the various components of our results, including both continuing and discontinued operations given the sale of Campbell Fresh and the pending divestitures of the Campbell International businesses.",
        "I'm pleased to say that in the fourth quarter, we continued to do what we said we would. This quarter showed meaningful improvement in our performance sequentially and versus a year ago across many measures. Additionally Q4 completes a fiscal year where we've made material progress on our strategic plan across the business. First and foremost, it starts with our performance. We are delivering results that are aligned with or exceeding our expectations, which is a critical first step in our journey to sustainable profitable growth. We have demonstrated improved operating discipline and this marks the fourth consecutive quarter this year that we have met or exceeded our own financial goals. It also marks the first quarter we delivered topline, gross margin and EPS growth in the year. Definitely a great way to finish.",
        "Second, we are well on our way to completing the divestitures of the non-core businesses we identified last year, shedding the underperforming Fresh businesses that added complexity to the portfolio and working toward closing on the two transactions related to Campbell International, both of which are expected to close in the first half of fiscal '20. This will do two critical things; it will improve our balance sheet and better focus of the business. In total, we expect net proceeds of approximately $3 billion from these transactions, which will be used to significantly reduce our debt.",
        "Finally, we've also developed a new straightforward strategy, which brings clear focus on one geography and two core businesses. It's a simple, yet powerful concept that enables us to concentrate our resources and investment on the things that matter most. This includes returning resources and innovation to our iconic meals and beverage brands like our Campbell Soup business, and accelerating support on our unique and differentiated snacking portfolio, including the Pepperidge Farm and Snyder's-Lance brands.",
        "We have accomplished a great deal this year, and I'm very satisfied with our progress. We have clearly stabilized the Company from where we were a year ago and delivered improved performance over the course of the year. By no means are we declaring victory. We have much to do to continue to strengthen our businesses, improve our marketing and innovation and demonstrate executional excellence consistently. However, the actions we have taken have removed a great deal of unpredictability around our business and created a solid foundation to build upon going forward.",
        "Now let's cover Q4 in more detail on Slide 6. This is the best quarter we have delivered in terms of performance versus prior year and provide some encouragement for the potential of our new focused portfolio, demonstrating what the business is capable of delivering. Looking at our combined results in the quarter, sales increased 2%, performance in the quarter reflected continued strength in the Snacks segment where organic sales increased 4% with contributions coming from across the business. In fact, we grew or held share in eight of our top nine Snack power brands.",
        "Meanwhile, the Meals & Beverage business continued to stabilize, delivering 1% organic sales growth. We also made progress on gross margin in the quarter. Another important proof point in our turnaround. Adjusted gross margin increased 60 basis points in the quarter. A material improvement versus the third quarter year-to-date, which was down significantly.",
        "We have also continued to successfully deliver our multi-year enterprise cost savings program. This quarter, we achieved $45 million in savings, including the Snyder's-Lance synergies. For the year, that brings our total savings to $165 million from continuing operations. We have achieved $560 million in savings program to date and continue to track to our cumulative savings target of $850 million by the end of fiscal '22.",
        "Cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion, reflecting major improvements in working capital as we continue to demonstrate increased discipline and effectiveness and optimizing our working capital.",
        "Turning to a discussion of our segments on Slide 8. Let's start with Meals & Beverages, which continued to stabilize. Results improved this quarter with organic sales up 1% behind the performance of soup, Prego and Pace. Declines in operating earnings moderated as we continued to drive base enablers and benefited from our selective pricing actions, which were more than offset by cost inflation. While we are encouraged by the performance to finish the year, we do not want to get ahead of ourselves. As we told you at Investor Day, there is much work ahead in fiscal '20.",
        "We still expect some volatility as we invest in the business and also make important choices to strengthen the portfolio for the future. In US soup, sales increased 3%, with gains in condensed and ready-to-serve soups, which is encouraging. Obviously, the fourth quarter is the smallest of the year. And it's important to keep in mind that we're wrapping significant declines from a year ago. However, it's also great to see end market consumption increase 1.4% in the quarter with strong performance across the portfolio. This represents a significant improvement over the first three quarters.",
        "Turning to Slide 9, across the board, we made progress with our fiscal '19 soup plans, which called for improving the fundamentals of the business, including improved retail engagement, pricing and promotion, and marketing. This is the foundation we'll build upon as we execute the next phase of the plans in fiscal '20 and fiscal '21. As we said, we're taking a full swing at soup with an integrated and holistic plan.",
        "Here's how we're thinking about soup over the next two years. In fiscal '20 on the plus side, we'll be injecting much needed investment in the businesses across quality, marketing, and selective merchandising, including returning our highly relevant Pacific brand to growth. We also hope to validate the new vision for the soup aisle that was outlined at Investor Day, while continuing to strengthen important retailer relationships. We do expect some mitigating headwinds as we continue to rationalize the portfolio and increase some unsustainable promoted price points.",
        "As we've said previously, we expect a more stable soup business in fiscal '20 with an improved trajectory in fiscal '21 that builds upon the F20 learnings and increases in investment in areas that are working or redirect is necessary complemented by a more robust innovation pipeline. This change will not happen overnight. The soup plan is a three-year journey with fiscal '20 being the second phase.",
        "In other parts of the division, I'm pleased with the performance of our sauces business. As we outlined in June, we have work to do on the Prego and Pace brands, but they are responding well to the renewed focus and support. Prego has delivered strong end-market performance in the quarter, with consumption growth and share gains. In fact, Prego has regained the share lead in the pasta sauce category, adding another number one brand to our roster. Meanwhile, Pace performed well in Q4, fueled by increased merchandising and effective customer programs.",
        "Turning to V8, the shelf-stable beverages category remained under pressure. While there are challenges in this business, its foundation is strong and its plant-based positioning is on trend. V8 is the number one vegetable juice in the US and the number two overall branded shelf-stable juice. We are continuing to work our way through some of the more disadvantaged parts of the portfolio, particularly Splash, which is driving the majority of the decline in the quarter and reshaping this business around the plant-based consumer macro trend and our single-serve business. That's our biggest opportunity with V8 Original and the differentiated V8 +Energy and hydration lines, all of which tap into the plant-driven benefits consumers are seeking.",
        "Let's take a look at our Snacks segment on Slide 11. This was another very good quarter for the business as we continue to drive strong sales performance with organic sales increasing 4%. I feel very good about the steady progress of the integration of the businesses, building on the complementary strengths of Pepperidge Farm and Snyder's-Lance. This year, we have over delivered our value capture while simultaneously unlocking the growth potential of this unique and differentiated portfolio by maintaining our momentum in Pepperidge Farm and applying our proven growth model to Snyder's-Lance.",
        "Our performance was balanced across snacks, as I mentioned earlier. Eight of our nine power snack brands grew or maintained share in the quarter. The snacks business is really hitting its stride on both the top and bottom line behind increased marketing investments to fuel sales growth and efficiencies and enablers benefiting operating profit. I continue to be impressed with the proven growth model of Pepperidge Farm. This marks the 19th consecutive quarter of organic growth at Pepperidge with sales again increasing mid-single digits behind strong marketplace performance across all the major brands.",
        "Goldfish continued to perform well with increases on the core business. Fresh bakery continued its strong growth trajectory, fueled by the renovation of swirl and new line extensions on buns and rolls. Farmhouse cookies also had double digit consumption gains.",
        "Now let's turn to the Snyder's-Lance side of the portfolio. Marketplace performance was improved this quarter, especially against our power brands. In particular, we're very pleased with the response of Cape Cod and Kettle to increased marketing, which drove consumption and share growth. In addition, the new campaign in Snyder's of Hanover is making a material difference as that business continues to improve.",
        "Now on Slide 13, beyond the power brands that we're investing in for growth, the Snyder's-Lance portfolio also includes what have been historically referred to as partner brands, brands that we distribute, but do not own and allied brands, regional brands that we own, but are non-core. Both play a very important role by providing distribution scale and efficiency.",
        "We remain committed to this business, but in the quarter, our Snacks results include about a 1-point headwind from these brands. Within this business, there are nearly 2,000 SKUs. We're going to better prioritize select partners to reduce complexity and improve execution, while maintaining the vast majority of this business. Looking ahead, we expect a similar headwind in fiscal '20.",
        "Let's dig into the progress of our integration and value capture. I'm more than satisfied with the pace and progress of the integration. In fact, we over-delivered synergies every quarter this year. The over-delivery in the quarter and for the full year is the result of very strong performance in the three areas we've discussed previously; synergies and procurement, specifically packaging; the consolidation of the sales headquarters and related operations, and driving operational efficiency and manufacturing. In addition, the leadership team continues to do an excellent job in building a winning culture across the combined businesses.",
        "Next on slide 15, I want to provide what should be one of our final updates on the divestitures we identified last August. In June, we announced the agreement to sell the Kelsen business to an affiliate of Ferrero. And in August, we announced the sale of the rest of Campbell International to KKR. We expect these divestitures to be completed in the first half of fiscal '20. The sale of Campbell International was a long and complex process, but we are confident that the end result generated the greatest value from these assets. In total, we will receive $2.5 billion for the Campbell International businesses. When you combine that with the divestiture of the Fresh businesses, we expect total net proceeds of approximately $3 billion, which will be used to significantly reduce our debt.",
        "In addition to improving the balance sheet, the divestiture of these businesses allow us to focus our resources on our two core North American businesses, which is already having a positive impact on our efficiency and performance. As we outlined at Investor Day, fiscal '19 was a reset year and fiscal ' 20 will be a year of stabilization, which will include the investments we need to better support the businesses going forward. This translates to what I would characterize as relatively flat with some areas of modest improvement. This guidance reflects the next step in our journey to sustainable profitable growth.",
        "As I'm sure, you all read in our press release yesterday, we announced that Anthony DiSilvestro will be leaving Campbell. This will be his final call as the Chief Financial Officer of the Campbell Soup Company. He will be succeeded by Mick Beekhuizen, who is joining us from Chobani. The start of the new fiscal year and the near completion of the divestiture provides an opportune time to make this change. Anthony will stay on Board until mid-October to ensure we have smooth and seamless transition to Mick.",
        "Anthony has made many important contributions during his more than two decades with Campbell. He has enjoyed a remarkable career and played a significant role in shaping the Company. I want to personally thank him for his partnership over the last several months and getting me up to speed on the business. For his leadership on the divestitures and driving the cost savings program and for the excellence in execution that is contributed to our improved performance this year,I speak for all of our employees and the Board when I wish Anthony the best as he moves on from Campbell.",
        "With that, let me turn it over to Anthony.",
        "Anthony P. DiSilvestro -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer",
        "Thanks, Mark. Before getting into the details, I'll make a few comments on our performance in the quarter. Overall, we had a good quarter with the result exceeding our expectations. We are pleased with improving trends in our gross margin performance as we benefited from cost and productivity savings as well as from net price realization. On our cost savings program, continued good progress as we achieved $45 million in savings in the quarter from continuing operations, bringing the year-to-date total to $165 million and the program to date total to $560 million.",
        "We are pleased with the progress on our divestiture program, having recently announced agreement to sell the Campbell International businesses. Completing the divestiture program will enable us to focus on our core North American market and with anticipated proceeds of approximately $3 billion, we will significantly reduce our debt level.",
        "Lastly, as we announced this morning, we are providing our 2020 guidance for continuing operations. As we discussed at our Investor Day in June, we expect stable performance in 2020 as we make the investments necessary to achieve long-term growth.",
        "I'll now review our detailed results. In my discussion, I'll focus primarily on the results for continuing operations. However, as we did last quarter, we will provide combined results consistent with the basis of our previous guidance. In this case, we will combine the results of continuing operations and the results of Campbell International. I'll start with continuing operations.",
        "For the fourth quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis increased 2% to approximately $1.8 billion. Organic sales also increased 2% with gains in Snacks as well as in Meals & Beverages. Adjusted EBIT of $252 million, increased 1% as sales gains and gross margin improvement were partly offset by higher marketing and selling expenses. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased by 14% or $0.05 to $0.42 per share, primarily due to a lower adjusted tax rate and a reduction in interest expense, driven by strong cash flow and proceeds from the Campbell Fresh divestiture.",
        "For the full year, net sales from continuing operations on an as-reported basis increased 23% to $8.1 billion, benefiting from acquisitions, while organic net sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in Snacks were offset by declines in Meals & Beverages. Adjusted EBIT from continuing operations increased 1% to $1.266 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.30 was down 8%, reflecting the incremental interest expense from acquisitions and a lower adjusted tax rate. And now on a combined basis and consistent with our previous guidance, net sales for the quarter increased 2% to $2 billion, adjusted EBIT of $288 million, increased 2% and adjusted EPS, which exceeded our expectations, increased by 14% to $0.50 per share.",
        "For the full year, combined net sales increased 18% to $9.2 billion, reflecting the acquisitions of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods, adjusted EBIT decreased 1% to $1.422 billion and adjusted net EPS of $2.63, declined 9% versus the prior year.",
        "Breaking down our net sales performance from continuing operations for the quarter. Organic net sales were up 2%, driven by a combination of increased volume and the benefit of recent pricing actions. Approximately 70 basis points of the sales growth is a result of lapping the lost sales related to the voluntary recall of Flavor Blasted Goldfish crackers in July 2018.",
        "Volume gains were driven by Snacks, while pricing gains were achieved across our two segments. Promotional spending was flat year-over-year, while the impact from currency translation in the quarter was neutral. As we refocused our portfolio on North America, we would expect currency translation impacts to be minimal. All-in, our as-reported net sales were up 2%.",
        "We are pleased with our gross margin results as we continue to achieve sequential improvement in performance. For continuing operations, our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 60 basis points to 33.7%. Cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 320 basis points. On a rate basis, input prices increased approximately 4%, reflecting higher prices on steel cans, vegetables, aluminum and wheat.",
        "Going the other way, our ongoing supply chain productivity program contributed 140 basis points and our cost savings program added 130 basis points to gross margin expansion. Net pricing contributed 50 basis points as we benefited from list pricing actions across several key categories and from lapping costs incurred related to the Flavor Blasted Goldfish recall last year. Reflecting strong sales gains in US soup, mix was favorable by 60 basis points, bringing the gross margin percentage to 33.7%.",
        "Moving on to other operating items; marketing and selling expenses increased 10% in the quarter, primarily reflecting increased marketing investment on Snacks and higher incentive compensation driven by improved performance, partly offset by benefits from cost savings initiatives. Adjusted administrative expenses increased 5% to $139 million, due primarily to the increased incentive compensation expense, partly offset by the benefits from cost savings initiatives.",
        "For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our adjusted EPS change between our operating performance and below the line items. Adjusted EPS increased $0.05 from $0.37 in the prior year quarter to $0.42 per share. On a currency neutral basis, adjusted EBIT had no impact on EPS as our increase in sales and gross margin were offset by higher marketing and selling expenses.",
        "Net interest expense declined by $5 million, a $0.01 positive impact to EPS as we have used our strong cash flow to reduce debt. Adjusted EPS benefited from a lower adjusted effective tax rate, adding $0.02 to EPS. Our adjusted effective tax rate declined by 4.2 points to 25.6%, benefiting from the reduced US federal rate. And lastly, currency translation had no impact on EPS this quarter, completing the bridge to $0.42 per share.",
        "Now turning to our segment results. In Meals & Beverages, organic sales increased 1%, reflecting sales gains in US soup, Prego and Pace, partly offset by declines in V8 beverages. Sales of US soup increased 3% versus the prior year, driven by gains in ready-to-serve and condensed soups. Segment operating earnings declined 3% to $151 million. The decline was driven primarily by cost inflation and higher incentive compensation expense, partly offset by supply chain productivity gains, the benefits of cost savings initiatives and the benefit of list pricing actions.",
        "Here's a look at US wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending July 28, 2019, the category declined 1.5%. Our sales in measured channels, including Pacific, declined 3.7% and our market share declined by 130 basis points. Private label sales grew 5.9% with a market share gain of 120 basis points. All other branded players collectively experienced a sales decline of 80 basis points, gaining 20 basis points of market share. As shown on the chart, our consumption and share trends are improving. For the 13-week period ending July 28, our sales and measured channels increased 140 basis points, with share declining just 90 basis points.",
        "In Campbell Snacks, sales in the quarter increased 3% to $967 million. Organic sales increased 4%. This performance reflects continued momentum in Pepperidge Farm bakery products, Kettle Brand potato chips, Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps and Late July snacks, as well as gains in Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers as the Company laps the negative impact of the voluntary recall in July 2018. As Mark mentioned, eight of our nine snack power brands grew or held market share in the quarter.",
        "Segment operating earnings increased 2% to $133 million as sales growth, cost savings and productivity gains were partly offset by cost inflation, increased marketing investment and higher incentive compensation. Cash from operations for fiscal 2019 increased by $93 million to about $1.4 billion, reflecting significant improvements in working capital performance and higher cash earnings. The cash outlay for capital expenditures was $384 million, $23 million lower than the prior year.",
        "Dividends paid in the amount of $423 million were comparable to the prior year, reflecting our current quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. Net debt of $8.533 billion declined by $1.135 billion compared to the prior year as positive cash flow generated by the business and proceeds from the divestiture of Campbell Fresh were used to reduce debt. We expect to close the divestiture of the Campbell International businesses in the first half of 2020 and we'll use the proceeds to further reduce our debt level.",
        "We are very pleased with the progress we've made on our divestiture program. On Campbell International, we now have agreements to sell our Kelsen business for $300 million and the balance of Campbell International for $2.2 billion. As mentioned, we anticipate closing on the International transactions in the first half of fiscal 2020. Together with the divestiture of our Campbell Fresh division, which was completed in the fourth quarter, we expect divestiture proceeds of approximately $3 billion and as discussed, these will be used to significantly reduce our debt level. The results of these businesses are now being reported as discontinued operations.",
        "For fiscal 2020, we are providing guidance for continuing operations, which excludes the results of Campbell International and Campbell Fresh. Fiscal 2020 is a 53-week year, including one additional week, which is included in our guidance and has about a 2 percentage point impact across net sales, EBIT and EPS. With our portfolio now focused in North America, currency translation is not expected to have a material impact as non-US dollar sales are now less than 10% of the total. Net sales are expected to increase 1% to 3%, reflecting the extra week, growth in Snacks, and improving trends in Meals & Beverages.",
        "Adjusted EBIT is expected to increase by 2% to 4%, reflecting sales growth and the benefits from our costs and synergy program and productivity gains, which are funding planned increases in marketing support. Adjusted EPS is expected to increase by 9% to 11%. As I'll detail for you in a moment, EPS is benefiting from the use of divestiture proceeds, including those anticipated from Campbell International to reduce debt. Although we don't provide quarterly guidance, I will say that we expect our first half results to be negatively impacted by accelerated marketing investments to support our Snacks business and to improve the performance of US soup.",
        "In addition, we expect cost inflation rates to moderate gradually throughout the year. Given the many moving parts to our financial reporting, we thought it would be helpful to provide additional details behind our EPS guidance. As discussed, 2019 results are a combination of discontinued and continuing operations.",
        "From the 2019 continuing operations base of $2.30, EPS will benefit from several drivers in 2020. First, interest expense will benefit from the use of C-Fresh divestiture proceeds and the anticipated proceeds from the international divestitures. Based on our anticipated closing in the first half, we expect an interest benefit of approximately $0.16 per share. This estimate is based on currently anticipated closing date and to the extent those change we will update you. Next, the additional week will add approximately $0.04 per share, while growth on the base business on a like-for-like basis add $0.00 to $0.05. Together, these drivers get us to our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance for continuing operations of $2.50 to $2.55. If you're using these numbers to calculate the dilution from our divestitures, please note that the interest benefits shown here is only a partial year. There was an estimated incremental $0.07, which will wrap into 2021.",
        "Turning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance. Although moderating somewhat, we expect cost inflation to be approximately 3% in 2020. As we have successfully delivered in the past, we expect ongoing supply chain productivity gains excluding the benefit of our cost savings program of approximately 2% to 3% of cost of products sold. Against our cost savings program, we expect to deliver an additional $140 million of cost savings, including a meaningful contribution from Snyder's-Lance synergies. Including the anticipated benefit of divestiture proceeds, we are forecasting interest expense in the range of $290 million to $300 million.",
        "Below the line and comparable to this year, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 24%. We are forecasting capital expenditures of approximately $350 million, a decrease from 2019 spending, reflecting the divestiture program. Lastly, and as Mark mentioned, I will be leaving the Company to pursue other interests. I have very much enjoyed my time here and certainly wish the Company all the success going forward.",
        "That completes my review, and now I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A.",
        "Ken Gosnell -- Vice President, Finance Strategy and Investor Relations",
        "Thanks, Anthony. We'll be happy to take your questions. Candace, let's open the lines and take our first question.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Your line is now open.",
        "Andrew Lazar -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst",
        "Good morning, everybody and Anthony all the best going forward. Thanks for your help over the years. Just two quick things. One would be, Mark I realize fiscal '20 is not yet the year where you have everything firing in terms of reframing the soup category, perhaps you could run through maybe just the sort of top two or three things in that core soup business that we should be focused on really in order to monitor the progress as we go through sort of the coming soup season. Maybe those key benchmarks or metrics that we can sort of focus on again to monitor the progress.",
        "And then just second as we think through the relationship between inflation and productivity and such, it seems like you're looking for, I would assume productivity and maybe some incremental pricing to about help offset what you expect inflation to be. Is it right to think that leaves the cost and synergy savings really as the -- what you have is flexibility to reinvest behind the business this coming year kind of that sort of $140 million bucket and such? Thank you so much.",
        "Mark A. Clouse -- President and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. Well, let me start with the soup question first. And maybe it will be helpful to give a little bit of context on what we're seeing in the marketplace right now and then how that kind of leads [Phonetic] into the 2020 assumptions. So on the positive side, a couple of things that we're finding are very helpful and it was great to see albeit this summer and the fourth quarter. It was great to see growth on soup, it's the first time in quite a number of years that we've been able to drive growth on the business and I think if you look under what's really driving that, I think there's three things.",
        "The first is, the power of partnering again with our retailers to really collaborate with them on creating a vision and direction for the category and for the business. And I think in many ways that is translating into a far better performance in market, better merchandising, better reflection of our innovation that we do have, and a good understanding of the right merchandising and pricing combination. I think the other thing that's been very effective has been the -- almost relaunch of Well Yes! behind the convenience platform. In the fourth quarter, that business was up 34% and added 0.3-point [Phonetic] of a share point.",
        "And so although we're light on innovation, as we've said in the past, I think the things that we are doing are working well. And so I would expect those positive drivers to carry forward into the 2020 season with the addition of a couple meaningful adds to that. So our marketing and the strength of both the investment levels as well as the quality of that communication, I'm very excited about as well as the investment in quality and some additional investments in pricing and the shelf, while we continue to cultivate those relationships with partners -- our retail partners as we go forward.",
        "I do think though there are a couple of headwinds that will moderate that and I'll get to the kind of benchmarks at the end. If you look under the results today, you do see a fair amount of contribution in the headwinds related to distribution. So where this is coming from is some of the flankers on the ready-to-serve side as well as what I would call some of the tail, if you will, of the condenser business.",
        "The majority of this distribution loss is not regrettable losses, but it is providing a bit of a headwind to the business. I do think that will moderate as we go through 2020, but I do expect still some headwinds from that. And then on the merchandising side, it will be a little bit of a balancing act. I expect to see us more aggressive on businesses like broth where we're seeing a lot more competitive tension, especially with private label. And I would see promoted prices in some places where there are just unsustainable levels going up, which I know in the -- and as we expect in the near-term, we'll see a little bit of headwinds from there.",
        "So as you go into the season, I think you want to look for one the executional performance of seeing the additional supported merchandising and market, the quality of that, the improvement on the products and the improved quality on the businesses as well as a more balanced approach to pricing and my expectation is that you should expect them to see a more stable performance through the season.",
        "I certainly am hoping and I think if we hit things on all cylinders, we'll see improvement in share as well. But I also think we're being prudent in setting expectations in a balanced way as we really validate some of the work we're doing, but I think going through the season if you were to see a more stable performance and an improving trajectory on share, I think that would be a successful season. And I think a great proof point on this next iteration of the business going forward.",
        "And then, Anthony. I don't know if you want to take the second,",
        "Anthony P. DiSilvestro -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer",
        "Yeah, sure.",
        "Mark A. Clouse -- President and Chief Executive Officer",
        "We can kind of do it together probably.",
        "Anthony P. DiSilvestro -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer",
        "Andrew, thanks for the comment, I think the way to think about it is on our $140 million of cost savings, think of about half of that going into costs and the other half going into marketing and SG&A. So within gross margin that combination of cost savings, productivity -- and productivity savings should be ahead of inflation. So it gives us some slight improvement in gross margin percentage. And then that will provide the fuel to reinvest back into the marketing line as we go into 2020.",
        "Mark A. Clouse -- President and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah, I just would say Andrew as you think about that though, one of the things we've tried to do in this plan is, there is a little bit in my mind I would say flexibility that we want relative to pricing and making sure that our price gaps remain within the targets that we want them. So I think we've, as you'll note from how we've laid out guidance we've stopped short of guiding directly, it's a gross margin because I do think we want a little bit of that flexibility. But I think the general balance of investment as it relates to inflation and productivity as Anthony laid out, right, all I would say is, I want to leave us a little bit of flexibility where that investment might land depending on how we see the environment unfold.",
        "Andrew Lazar -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst",
        "Great. Thanks so much.",
        "Mark A. Clouse -- President and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Does that make sense?",
        "Andrew Lazar -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst",
        "It does. Really appreciate the color.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.",
        "Ken Goldman -- JP Morgan -- Analyst",
        "Hi, thank you. And Anthony, best of luck for me as well. Thanks for all your help over the years.",
        "Anthony P. DiSilvestro -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer",
        "You're welcome.",
        "Ken Goldman -- JP Morgan -- Analyst",
        "Mark, on Slide 13, I think it is, you highlighted, I think 17% of the snacking business being non-core and sort of broke out how you think about classifying some of those assets. History might suggest that when companies do this, sometimes the signal is that some of these businesses are being considered for divestiture. So, I wasn't sure if that's what you're implying by breaking it out and emphasizing it in this way, but I kind of wanted to just get a little bit more color on what you were -- on the messaging from that slide?",
        "Mark A. Clouse -- President and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah, thanks, Ken. I think that the point of it was, I do think it's more about the 11%, which is the partner and allied brands. I know everybody's familiar in general with what those are. But we haven't talked a lot about it. And I think as we've gone through it, we've now spent a year or so running it. We recognize the importance of that business, but I also would say there is a tremendous amount of complexity that's inherent with that. If you think about the addition as I said in my comments of almost 2,000 SKUs that we're trying to manage, what I would tell you is, there is some really good parts of that business and there is some other parts that are very low margin adds a lot of complexity. And I think as we go forward and we really want to get this business set for the future, we're going to balance that.",
        "So focus on the parts of it that we really see is enhancing that efficiency and scale as it was originally set up to do and there's probably some parts of that that will rationalize going forward. And I know a lot of times as we reconcile the growth rate on Snacks, for example, in this particular quarter, our power brands on Snyder's-Lance grew 3% in market, while the total Snyder's-Lance business was up about 1.5% or so. And that difference, I think is important just to understand that going forward as I would expect that to continue going forward. The balance of the non-core businesses, which are primarily our Emerald nuts business and our Pop Secret business are actually been pretty stable contributors. And right now, will always kind of review the portfolio and look at the longer term desire to have the optimal mix. I think right now, we're feeling pretty good with that base business as we move forward and we'll continue to look at it, but more importantly for us, I think in this messaging was really about understanding the partner and allied brands, a little better.",
        "Ken Goldman -- JP Morgan -- Analyst",
        "Okay, thank you for that. That's helpful and then some of the efforts that you're making this year require a little bit of a buy-in for lack of a better word from your customers, right. Whether it comes to some on-shelf changes for where you'd like condensed to be placed or certain changes in RTS and at the same time, I think by your own [Phonetic] admission, there's a decent innovation slate coming, but most of it or the bigger one is coming next year. So, can you update us on sort of how your relationship is with those customers right now. And with all of those changes. And I guess I could mention sort of lifting some promotional prices as well. Right now, is everything going sort of swimmingly as you expected, or is there a little bit of push back right now in the process?",
        "Mark A. Clouse -- President and Chief Executive Officer",
        "I think overall it's -- I would say it's going very well. And in fact, I think in many ways a little harder to quantify this, as you get into the journey, but the reality is, I think in many ways we've been absent from the dialog strategically with our customers on the vision in the future for these businesses and I think as we're getting back to the table really rolling up our sleeves and starting to see investment come and focus in a very different way, the receptiveness to work together has been very, very positive. And I think a lot of times, we've talked about the challenges in soup as a category, but remember the significance of how big this category is and what it represents for center of store for most of the retailer universe, it's critical there is a vision and a plan for this.",
        "And so as you look again, I get it a summer quarter, but as you look at a quarter like Q4, where you see overall positive response, not just in our business, but also improvement in the overall category, it goes a long ways to keep people interested and engaged. Now, I will say, I think as perhaps it's appropriate, I think a lot of the retail universe wants to see the results as does I think all of us in the effectiveness of some of the programs and the plans we are doing. But as far as where we are in the journey right now and where we've come from. I really could not be more pleased, with the receptiveness and the collaboration of our retail partners.",
        "Ken Goldman -- JP Morgan -- Analyst",
        "Great. Thank you.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is now open.",
        "Bryan Spillane -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst",
        "Hey, good morning, everybody and all the best from me as well, Anthony. Thank you.",
        "Anthony P. DiSilvestro -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer",
        "Thanks, Bryan.",
        "Bryan Spillane -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst",
        "So I guess first question just Anthony, if you could just give us or let us know net leverage on a pro forma basis, so like once the proceeds are put to work. I'm getting around 3 times, is that right?",
        "Anthony P. DiSilvestro -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer",
        "Yeah, obviously. I mean our target remains 3times debt-to-EBITDA, but we won't quite get there with the current proceeds. Need a little more time with the base business generating positive cash flow, but we will make a meaningful reduction when we get the proceeds in.",
        "Bryan Spillane -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst",
        "Okay. And then I guess, Mark, as we're thinking about that, you're going to get closer to that target, how do you think about ongoing sort of returning cash to shareholders. Just the thoughts about dividend increases or share repurchases. Just how you kind of think about that going forward?",
        "Mark A. Clouse -- President and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah, I mean I think as we get to more stable footing, we will continue to look at the best deployment of capital. And again, I think all of those are areas that we will continue to explore and make sure that we're trying to optimize value, while also again, I've said this before, although I think it will come in a very different context perhaps than where we've been in the immediate past, but I do think there are going to likely be some opportunities for some tuck-in M&A as well. And as we go forward, we'll begin to frame that in a little bit more clarity, but I do think I'd stop short to say right now what the priorities are, but of course, our focus is going to be on maximizing shareholder value and we'll continue to look at all those options and working with the Board to find the plans going forward.",
        "But certainly, it is good, and I think in many ways, as I think about '19, as we complete the year, I think one of the strongest elements of that -- of this year has been that, we have taken a lot of that uncertainty for the business off the table. And so whether that is the balance sheet, whether that is a much more diverse portfolio as it relates to international and the Fresh business. I think the good news for us is our core business now and the predictability of it relative to the variables that we're controlling, I feel really good about that and I think that I hope that will also be a strong statement for investors as well as you're thinking about how to view our business going forward. And although we've got some important proof points in '20 to deliver, taking some of that downside off the table, I think is a very good progress for us in a year that saw a lot of moving parts.",
        "Bryan Spillane -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst",
        "Okay. And if I can just one last quick one, are there any stranded costs related to the divestitures that you'll be absorbing this year that might go away next year?",
        "Mark A. Clouse -- President and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah. And I think we talked about this last quarter. There is about $20 million with each business both Campbell Fresh and Campbell International. I think the way to think about it is that, that becomes part of our addressable spend on the core against, which our cost savings program is going to address and get after. Or said another way, Bryan, we contemplated to a certain degree those stranded costs as we went through the organizational redesign and restructure that we just rolled out a month ago. So the progress to get there, but we certainly had visibility to that and thought about that in some of the design work we've been doing.",
        "Bryan Spillane -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst",
        "All right. Thanks for that. Have a great Labor Day.",
        "Mark A. Clouse -- President and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah, you too, Bryan. Thanks.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.",
        "Jason English -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst",
        "Hey, good morning, folks. And Anthony, congrats on a great career at Campbell and good luck on the next chapter.",
        "Anthony P. DiSilvestro -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer",
        "Thanks.",
        "Jason English -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst",
        "I've got a couple of questions. First, real quick housekeeping kind of picking up where Mr. Spillane led us on the leverage. Can you give us your expectation for cash from operations in fiscal '20 and your best estimate of where you're going to land from a leverage perspective by year-end?",
        "Anthony P. DiSilvestro -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer",
        "So a couple of comments to make on cash, but we had a fantastic year this year on cash from operations and free cash flow, but as you think about going forward, we don't expect to be at the same level we are today. And first of all, two reasons; one is Campbell Fresh was a positive cash flow generator; Campbell International was a positive cash flow generator. We won't have those in the portfolio going forward.",
        "We had great progress on working capital this year. And so although we expect to continue to reduce our working capital, probably not at the same pace that we did this year, so that being said, we do expect to continue to generate significant positive cash from operations. That's one of the attributes of this business. But I don't think we're going to give you an exact number on that one. And in terms of the leverage ratio, I think we'll be meaningfully below 4 times debt-to-EBITDA by the end of 2020.",
        "Jason English -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst",
        "And is the unwillingness to kind of frame the cash flow a factor of just too many moving pieces right now? I guess I'm a little confused on the lack of clarity on that?",
        "Anthony P. DiSilvestro -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer",
        "Yeah, I mean, we're still working through it. In terms of finalizing our 2020 expectations for cash flow. So we just need to work through it ourselves first and foremost.",
        "Jason English -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst",
        "Okay. And the next question coming back to soup, the last couple of years have been a bit anomalous just in terms of the cadence of your soup bill [Phonetic] because the promotional support at retail, historically, you've been much heavier shipping in the first quarter in prep for soup season with the improved relationships with retailers and the slightly more aggressive stance, should we expect this to be a more normalized year?",
        "Mark A. Clouse -- President and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah I think so, Jason. We're watching closely, I mean one of the things we are realizing though is that, and even if you look at this last quarter, we've been kind of, I would say, running a bit in front of consumption with our net sales and our shipments. And part of that is a little bit of what we're lapping from a year ago, but it is also a little bit of the recognition that as we strengthen our merchandising programs, the inventory levels that retailers are needing to support that is a little bit higher than it might have been historically. But I do expect as we get into '20 to have a more normalized year on that. You'll always see a bit of inventory that's going to build in front of the season just because of the step up in display and merchandising, but I do think, as we kind of manage through the year, I don't think you'll see quite the volatility up and down as we did in '19.",
        "Jason English -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst",
        "Okay, very good. Thanks, I'll pass it on.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Growe from Stifel. Your line is now open.",
        "Chris Growe -- Stifel Nicolaus -- Analyst",
        "Hi, good morning. And Anthony, my best wishes to you as well. Thanks so much for all your help over the years.",
        "Anthony P. DiSilvestro -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer",
        "Thanks.",
        "Chris Growe -- Stifel Nicolaus -- Analyst",
        "I just wanted to ask a quick question I could on Meals & Beverages, it's a business that is -- it's stabilizing and you had a good fourth quarter performance and that comes amid, it seem like little incremental spending this year. You talked about some of the factors that led to the better performance, but I want to get a sense of, given the success you're seeing already and your desire to spend more aggressively in fiscal '20, do you expect that's really take a step forward in fiscal '20. If I can relate to that, how much spending you talked about $70 million if I recall or so at the Investor Day. Does that all of that come through in fiscal '20 or is that going to spread over the future?",
        "Anthony P. DiSilvestro -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer",
        "Yeah. So a couple of things just to ground back on the numbers. So the $70 million we talked about was the soup investment. Overall if you include the Snacks business and the broader Meals & Beverage business, it's a bigger number. What we said was about a half -- about half of our cost savings target over the next couple of years is what we've carved out, if you will, as the investment dollars we're planning. I do think you'll see that a bit more front loaded in 2020 as we talked about it, which is a little bit of why I think the calibration of a more neutral year is expected.",
        "On Meals & Beverage, I do think there continues to be some puts and takes. We are encouraged by the support that we're seeing across the businesses, but we do have some work as we've said to make sure that we're doing the right things to set up the portfolio for the future. While getting that investment in place, and again I do think an important aspect of this will be the contribution from innovation, which really is more of a 21 factor. I also think we're trying to be a bit pragmatic and in how we're positioning expectations as we validate some of the work that we're doing and I think the good news is, if we're successful, more comprehensively on many of these things, I do think you'll see an improvement in that Meals & Beverage business as we go forward.",
        "And I think we will continue to update milestones along the way, but certainly seeing the performance on soup, seeing improvement in Prego and Pace, although V8 is still showing declines, I would tell you that the primary driver of that decline is Splash as we work through how we want to position that business for the future, which is including some rationalization on distribution and really trying to get that to a business that we think is the appropriate manageable level, while we then pivot on support for the more plant-based messaging that we see on the core V8 business as well as the V8 plus which is energy and hydration and our single-serve can business.",
        "So again I think we've got really clear roadmaps now for these businesses and I certainly hope that we continue to perform well, but I do think I want to be a bit balanced as we go forward until we validate some of this effort and some of the work. Does that make sense, Chris?",
        "Chris Growe -- Stifel Nicolaus -- Analyst",
        "Yeah, absolutely does. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. That was good color and that's what I was looking forward. Thank you. I have just one other quick one behind that, If I could, which is, there was a comment about over delivering on the value capture, also the integration was on track. Are you getting savings more quickly or more savings? Just trying to get my head around what over delivering means there?",
        "Anthony P. DiSilvestro -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer",
        "Yeah, I think it's really savings more quickly. So I think we've been able to execute on a few initiatives ahead of Pace. I don't think it's truly incremental to the program, but I do think we're obviously continuing to keep that pressure on as we go into '20 to continue to try to move initiatives as fast as we can as we want to unlock that and is that the fuel for the investment that we need on the business. We're pleased that we're getting to it sooner, but I would not say that we're seeing it as truly incremental savings for the overall program.",
        "Chris Growe -- Stifel Nicolaus -- Analyst",
        "Okay, that's good color too. Thanks so much for your time and have a great weekend. Thank you.",
        "Mark A. Clouse -- President and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Thanks, Chris.",
        "Operator",
        "Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.",
        "Robert Moskow -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst",
        "Hi, thanks and best wishes to you, Anthony. Just a couple of clarifying things, Mark. We -- the price adjustments that you're making in soup, it sounds like there is several things -- is there some deep discounts you want to walk away from, but then you're -- are you also saying that there is going to be some items where you want to reduce price to become more competitive. And then secondly on soup, can you give us a little more specifics on the quality improvement that you want to make and where you think there's quality gaps versus competition?",
        "Mark A. Clouse -- President and Chief Executive Officer",
        "Yeah. Great question. So your depiction of the pricing is exactly right. So to give you a little bit more color on that. I do think especially as you look at our Chunky business, I would say we and the absence of some of the support in marketing, I think some of the promoted price points that we've seen are more aggressive than what I would say is appropriate and sustainable. I mean one of the things that, as I've said before, that's quite powerful about Chunky is the quality of that product and its ability to really to beat essentially any of the other ready-to-eat soups on a quality perspective.",
        "And so when we're dealing at so deep on price, I just don't think that's the right platform. Now, what we will try to do is balance a little bit of that with some frequency and then of course a much more robust marketing program around it. And I think though in as we've all seen this before, I also don't want to over set those expectations as I know there will be some perhaps short-term impact of that as we move off it, but it's absolutely the right thing to do to create the margin stability, and really the positioning of the brand going forward.",
        "Conversely, I think if you look at broth where we're seeing the greatest amount of competition, I think there, although I'm not -- I would not say we want to get deeper on promoted price points, I do think our frequency has opportunity to increase as we make sure that those price gaps especially in critical parts of the season are more competitive.",
        "And so I think on both the broth business and selectively on condensed where we still see a little bit of outlier as it relates to particular price gaps, I think you'll continue to see us again, not so much on lowering absolute price points, but adding appropriate frequency on merchandising. So that's the balancing act on pricing.",
        "And your second question is actually a great combination to that discussion on pricing which is quality. So the places where I think we have the greatest competitive pressure, whether it's on broth or whether it's on condensed is where you're going to see a significant step up in quality and that will come both from some product improvements and investment. So think of enhancing ingredients and again as I said at Investor Day, we're really focused on our four core SKUs and flavors on condensed, which are Cream of Mushroom, Cream of Chicken, chicken noodle and tomato.",
        "So across all four of those, you will see a combination of improvement in quality, while also really heightening some of the inherent benefits of the products within the existing formulations that we think are much stronger differentiation than we've been using in the past, whether that is double stock and simmer time on broth, whether it's six tomatoes in every can of tomato soup, there's a variety of things that we think we can really use to help. And we've done extensive research now to really understand especially on our lapsed users. So the consumers that are either trading to lower price offerings or departing our segments, what is really driving that behavior and we've targeted the quality improvements to really try to answer those questions.",
        "And so we're feeling really good about that and I think most of that will be ready as we go in the season, there will be a few of the quality improvements that will either flow in in the back half of the season or a couple that likely won't be fully in place until '21, but I am feeling good about what we'll have to work with as we go into the '20 soup season.",
        "Robert Moskow -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst",
        "It's very helpful. And before I let you go here. You mentioned some flanker products in RTS and condensed that lost distribution. Is that new since the Analyst Day, or was that already contemplated when we met [Phonetic]?",
        "Mark A. Clouse -- President and Chief Executive Officer",
        "It was already contemplated, but I do think, as we start to try to help everybody see the detail of the soup results because we are all obviously going to be watching it very closely. What I'm really trying to do is make sure we're really crystal clear on what the puts and takes are and to a certain degree why -- why our expectations, what they are. I do think there are some elements within that distribution that again, I do expect it to mitigate and of course once we get the innovation going, that's going to be a big help, but I do think there are some things within both of those businesses that I would expect to see, especially in the first half of the year.",
        "Robert Moskow -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst",
        "That's great. All right. Thanks so much.",
        "Mark A. Clouse -- President and Chief Executive Officer",

        "Craig Yan Zeng -- Chief Financial Officer",
        "Thank you, Jay, and hello, everyone. I'm pleased to announce that we have once again delivered strong results. But first, restatement of our first quarter 2019 results. In connection with [Indecipherable] of the Company's unaudited financial information, we identified some errors that overstated revenue for the quarter ended March 31. As a result, we have restated the unaudited financial result for the first quarter. Upon identifying these errors, we undertook a review of our relevant internal control processes and started to implement additional measures to address potential control deficiencies. For more details, please refer to our earnings press release.",
        "Now, moving on to our second quarter results. In the interests of time, I would not go over line item by line item of our financials. For a more detailed discussion of our second quarter 2019 results, please also refer to our earnings press release. Total operating revenue for the second quarter 2019 reached RMB2.5 billion, driven by strong growth in our financial service income. Adjusted net income was RMB671 million, reflecting our continued strong growth in the performance. You should be noted that on a year-on-year comparison basis, last year, the second quarter 2018 net income benefited from a one-time tax gain. Net income per ADS for the quarter was RMB3.46 on a fully diluted basis. Non-GAAP fully diluted net income per ADS was RMB3.69. Again, it should be noted that the second quarter 2018 benefited from a one-time tax gain.",
        "We continue to see the future potential of our business model. In the performance of the customer cohort, whom we acquired in the first quarter of 2015, whose balance is now over RMB13,700 and whose 30 days delinquency rate is still approximately 1% with a stable level of quarterly active rates at 37%. Our operating leverage, operating expenses as a percentage of average loan balance is now 5.5% in the year-to-date. And non-advertisement marketing, advertising, G&A and R&D was 2.1%, 1.3%, 1% and 1.1% of average loan balance, respectively.",
        "We currently have 50.2 million registered users and 13.5 million customers with credit line, up from 8.9 million in the June 30, 2018. We acquired nearly 1.3 million new active customers in the second quarter. Overall, our average credit limit was approximately RMB9,400 while our tenor has increased to 12.8 months. Our weighted average APR was at 25.3%.",
        "In terms of our funding, for the quarter, approximately 22.1% of our funding for new loan origination came from our Juzi Licai platform, and 77.9% of our funding for new loan originations came from our institution funding partners.",

        "Our 90 days delinquency ratio remains low at 1.49%, and we continue to see strong credit performance as our lifetime charge-off ratio is just over like [Phonetic] 2.5%. We fully expect our strong credit performance to continue for the full year 2019.",

        "Good evening. Thank you for taking my questions.",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "So I have two questions. The first one is regarding the recent news flow on the regulation of our P2P platforms. So wondering if the management team has any preparation? Should there be any change in the regulation environment for our P2P platforms, especially regarding potential loss of our licensing opportunity. And then secondly, about the sales and marketing costs. We have seen our first strong user growth along with the higher sales and marketing costs. So just wondering in terms of strategy, was it more just a second quarter one-time promotion or is it a strategy that we should be focusing on user growth, which also implies potentially pretty high sales and marketing cost in the near term? Thank you.",
        "Jay Wenjie Xiao -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "Tony Hung -- Investor Relations",
        "So Eddie, on the first question, on the P2P, I think Jay first wants to highlight that overall the regulatory environment as a whole is fairly stable. In particular, when it comes to the assisted lending model as well as for consumer finance. Overall, the government, we can see, is definitely encouraging consumer finance, in particular, and has stepped up with policies to support that. Now on the new P2P rules or other things associated with P2P, we are seeing different regulatory authorities in different jurisdictions say slightly different things news wise, and of course we have received some of the news as well.",
        "Now, overall as a whole [Indecipherable], we've heard some of these things and we're very much prepared as well. And when it comes to the three reductions, if you will, that the government would like to do, we're also in the process of executing and reducing the scale and number of users, etc. Now, it's notable and perhaps most important to highlight that while this is happening, institutional funding is strong. It's very strong. In fact, while -- you can see from our data that while the P2P [Indecipherable] not only not growing, where it is in fact it's flat or its even down, we're actually still growing and we're still growing rapidly and we still continue to deliver on the results.",
        "And I can say also from the latest numbers in the second quarter, days and times we're at 99% of loan origination is in fact coming from institutional funding. So again, that's 99% nearly all coming from institutional funding. So in the future, if there is in fact continued tightening, continued, if you will, restrictions around the P2P, we can see that basically we'll continue with our growth, whether it's in terms of our loan originations scale and we'll continue to meet the numbers.",
        "Jay Wenjie Xiao -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "Tony Hung -- Investor Relations",
        "So regarding the marketing costs and the strategy overall, I think as everyone can see from the second quarter results, that's to our work with institutions and the cooperation that we have with them. We have the opportunity now to grow at this rate. But as you can see from the growth and the growth as well in the marketing costs, ultimately our costs relatively still isn't that high. For customer, it's basically over RMB100. Now, this is the more immediate policy and the more immediate things that we need to do. But for the third quarter, we expect to see continued growth as well in terms of our customer numbers.",

        "Alex Ye -- UBS -- Analyst",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "So I will [Indecipherable] question. My first question is on the -- follow up on the customer acquisition cost. So we have seen that Lexin has increased its investment in sales and marketing in this quarter, but also, at the same time, maintained very good efficiency on customer acquisition. So if we look at the per customer cost on -- per user -- per approved user of this credit line. So it seems your customer acquisition cost has slightly declined QonQ. So can you share with us how tight did Lexin achieve this, given the industry trend of rising customer acquisition costs? And could you share your view on your future trend on this per customer acquisition costs?",
        "And my second question is on your institutional funding model. So I would like to know how -- what percentage of your current institutional funding is now under complete risk free model where the funding partners take all the risk, and given that we should expect such a model will lead to a slightly lower pick rate for Lexin. So how should we expect that future margin for Lexin given the gradual shift? And second, do we have any specific target percentage on what percentage of our institutional funding will be under such a risk-free model in the future? Thanks.",
        "Jay Wenjie Xiao -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "Tony Hung -- Investor Relations",
        "So I think it's important to point out on the customer acquisitions from the beginnings of the Company to now, Lexin has always adopted a multi-channel model. We have online, offline, we have, of course, also referrals. We have consumption scenarios. We have our own e-commerce. And as a result, these benefits our overall situation, and our sales and marketing costs as a whole. Now the sales and marketing costs is up in the second quarter. We have spent up to RMB100 million in terms of advertising and brand building. But overall, our numbers are approximately about the same in terms of customer acquisition in Q1 versus Q2, something like RMB150 million versus RMB149 million.",
        "Jay Wenjie Xiao -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer",
        "RMB115 million.",
        "Tony Hung -- Investor Relations",
        "I'm sorry, RMB115 million versus RMB119 million. Now in the future, in terms of how we'll continue to do things, it will very much be a lot of the same. It's not going to be a situation where, for example, the industry grows and then we grow. Now, we have our own systems and we have our own ways of acquiring customers. So hence we'll continue to grow and we'll probably continue to exhibit strong growth as a result. Now, that said, because of the amount that we spent on ads and brand building in the second quarter, this has, of course, naturally led to an increase in traffic, which then, of course, leads to additional customer acquisition for the quarter.",
        "Jay Wenjie Xiao -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "Tony Hung -- Investor Relations",
        "So I also want to add, in addition to everything that we just mentioned, there are also certain natural intrinsic benefits, if you will, to the Lexin ecosystem, which arises from the fact that we have consumption scenarios and we have an e-commerce platform. So, for example, if there are products that right now it can be offered at preferential rates, then we benefit from the natural customer flow that comes from that. Similarly, we have the ability to give our customers better deals, including, of course, better APRs.",
        "Jay Wenjie Xiao -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "Tony Hung -- Investor Relations",
        "So regards to the question on the institutional funding and in particular the type of funding whereby we have a full pass through of the risks to the institutional funding partners, where the profitability can be lower, I think it's perhaps best that we point out that similar to other things within the Lexin system, our funding and risk model is also diversified. And we do have multiple options which we keep and explore at different times.",
        "In terms of how it works, whether it's on the guarantees or the risk pass through as well as the economics, it's basically a negotiation and it depends on the ultimate economic split and we adjust depending on the exact situation. So right now you can say that overall this probably not a particular goal in mind for the future rather, it's something that we continue to negotiate which will adjust depending on the market environment.",

        "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Lucy Li from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.",
        "Lucy Li -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst",
        "[Foreign Speech] I'll briefly translate my questions. The first one is on funding cost. We noticed that even though the quarter-to-quarter funding cost has been stable, but the funding cost in the first half of this year has been more expensive than the average of last year. Given that the liquidity condition from bank side is relatively abandoned, are we -- we can fairly expect the funding cost to us to gradually becomes cheaper for the rest of the year?",
        "And then the second question is regarding the restatement of the financial results in 1Q. I would be very much appreciate it if management could explain in more details on the restatement and what kind of -- what have we done to prevent such things from happening again? And then related to that, we noticed that the interest yield for the on balance sheet loan for the 1Q will be lowered down to 20% and we observe a significant gap between the 20% versus the APR of 25% would appreciate a explanation. Thank you.",
        "Jay Wenjie Xiao -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "Tony Hung -- Investor Relations",
        "Yes. So Lucy, on your first question on the funding cost, it might be because you're looking a little bit more at the on balance sheet portions, which are historicals. So as we all know, last year the historical cost tended to be more expensive. Now for the new funding that we have, that's not necessarily the case, but it should be noted that our approach to funding is that we take a diversified approach. So in terms of the diversification, and in terms of the model, it can vary and it'll adjust according to the market environment. But we do very much focused on a few things when it comes to our funding, which is to continue to manage and maintain diversified sources to spread the risk. And most -- perhaps most importantly, maintain multiple channels and options. But again, on the more expensive cost, that might just be the historical cost, if you will.",
        "Jay Wenjie Xiao -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "Tony Hung -- Investor Relations",
        "Okay. So overall, I think, first, you can say that the problem was perhaps in two areas, but obviously we are very apologetic about the fact that such a situation has occurred. Now the two areas, one was with regards to the release during the season or certain coupons or benefits package. There was perhaps some tracking that was not done properly, internally. Also, for certain of our better customers on the longer tenor, we provided them with certain benefits. It was perhaps also not accounted for or tracked property.",
        "Now since then, we certainly have done a lot to verify and to put a new processes toward it and also to confirm a lot of the information. And perhaps it's worth pointing out that a lot of this arose as a result of the fact that we've adopted 606 and also new systems. So it was discovered by us during the one-time process of adopting new systems. So it is quite likely that this is, if you will, a one-time item that results from this as a result. But we very much have put in new systems in place as part of the process to prevent such a thing from occurring again.",
        "Jay Wenjie Xiao -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "Tony Hung -- Investor Relations",
        "So overall, I think I want to emphasize that we're pretty confident now in our ability to prevent such an incident from occurring again. And on your other question, with regards to the APR, for the first quarter APR after the adjustments, I think it's always worth pointing out that the on balance sheet portion quite often because of the recent adjustment, can't necessarily be symbolic or representative of some of the things that is going on underlying in our business. So basically it might not be a good representation of the business.",

        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "Thank you for taking my question. This was Alan from Aletheia Capital. I have a quick questions on asset quality in recent weeks with all other banks report their first half '19 results, and we saw a general increasing retail loan NPL. We're little bit concerned about Lexin's asset quality and given Lexin's customer is less prime as compared to banks customers.",
        "We also noticed that Lexin's 90 days delinquency ratio has gone up to 1.49%. I'm wondering if management can give us some colors on asset quality and share with us if you have put in place any pre-emptive measures to deal with a potential credit cycle. Thank you.",
        "Ryan Huanian Liu -- Chief Risk Officer",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "Tony Hung -- Investor Relations",
        "So I think -- translating for Ryan, our CRO. The first thing that's probably worth mentioning and discussing is the overall bank credit card environment. It should be noted that two years ago as FinTech was really, really growing rapidly in China, the banks and in particular the banks issuing credit cards, not a lot of pressure. And from this pressure, they actually issued far too many cards. And in fact, far too many cards to lower quality borrowers. So overall, I know for a fact that the quality of the borrowers by the banks are definitely down over this time period.",
        "And in fact, one can even say that in terms of the two years, the difference in terms of the quality of borrowers is substantial enough now that the new borrowers, a lot of them, there is actually very substantial overlap with payday loans. So naturally, as a result, what you're seeing today is that the credit card numbers are in fact, worse. But for us, the cohort that we're targeting are the educated young adults. And of course, these are far better quality credit than the payday loan borrowers.",
        "Does that answer your question or we actually continuing?",
        "Ryan Huanian Liu -- Chief Risk Officer",
        "Yes. [Foreign Speech]",
        "Tony Hung -- Investor Relations",
        "So Alan, overall in terms of -- again, in terms of our customers, they're really much more like prime customers. So this is not going to be the situation where, again, the bank credit cards now are doing a lot of subprime payday loan types. And these are very much new customers on our part. Again, the young educated, young adults customers, recent graduates, they're not really connected, in fact, to the bank credit card industry or what is going on there.",
        "Also, it's worth noting that these are individuals who very, very much care about their future. Therefore, they also care about their credit and managing their credit, which is why we continue to be stable and we continue to maintain a very, very good position.",
        "Now, with regards to the rates that you mentioned, right now we're about 1.49%. Historically we're, I'd say, between 1.4% to 1.5%. So this is clearly within the range and stable. Now, the 1.49% part of it is a fact that during this time we have been doing some tests and are doing some experiments. So as a result, you can view the -- what are the changes as the costs or the expenses associated with those tests.",
        "Ryan Huanian Liu -- Chief Risk Officer",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "Tony Hung -- Investor Relations",
        "So with regards to the next 12 months, we'll certainly continue to maintain a very careful, if not conservative, outlook and be very, very careful about the market risks. We'll certainly keep a close eye on the situation, but we'll certainly do all the things requires to maintain, if you will, a very conservative and good quality credit.",

        "[Foreign Speech] I'll briefly translate my two questions. The first one is a follow up on asset quality. Can you help to illustrate how we can avoid the low quality customers from bank? Because for an applicant who provides information with their bank card details, then they could as well appear as a prime customer. But it seems that we have successfully avoided this client group by far.",
        "And the second question is on the growth outlook for the second half. Can you help to illustrate for the growth for the second half. Would it mainly come from the existing clients or the new clients? And if it's for the new clients, how do we acquire such clients? Is it from the offline new scenarios or the online and it would be great if you can explain more on the Le Card [Phonetic]. Thank you.",
        "Jay Wenjie Xiao -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "Tony Hung -- Investor Relations",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "So let me translate first the answer on the first question. So in terms of how we're able to do things that the banks aren't able to do well, fundamentally, when we actually go out to measure the risk and assess the risk, we're probably doing something that is much more comprehensive than what the banks are doing. So, for example, in first half our cases where typically we look at 7,000 data points for individual customers versus what the banks might get from a form associated with a credit card. Similarly, when you look at the underlying customers that the banks might be issuing credit cards to, they might be issuing to someone who's, for example, 40 years old or also someone who is basically the delivery guy. Those are actually customers that we wouldn't want, and so hence we actually avoid a lot of the customers that the banks would go after.",
        "Jay Wenjie Xiao -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "Tony Hung -- Investor Relations",
        "So overall, in terms of the second half and how we'll get to the RMB70 billion of the amount that's remaining in our guidance, well, first up, let us say that actually now that we're two months into the third quarter, we have probably accomplished a not small part of that RMB70 billion already. So hence as a result, we're very much full of confidence in our ability to achieve our goal.",
        "With regards to the customer acquisition, things are very much not just on track, but doing very, very well. In fact, we are looking at the third quarter that's going to, in fact, also even be better than the second quarter. We've acquired actually something like 1 million customers in a single month. So things are definitely doing very, very well.",
        "In terms of the loans or the low origination that's going to come from new versus old, we're looking at probably something like 30% coming from new customers. And overall, in terms of how we acquire customers, we have talked about this earlier. But essentially it's going to always be an integrated approach that incorporates offline, referrals, our e-commerce as well as advertising and promotion.",

        "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of John Cai from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question.",
        "John Cai -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst",
        "[Foreign Speech] So thank you for taking my questions. My first question is about customer acquisitions. So it's very excited to hear the Company has recently increased the new customer per month to over 1 million. So I just wonder as we can see that when the customer increase, sales and marketing on online customer acquisition this quarter the effect is very notable. So just wonder whether there would be a future major customer acquisition trend of ours. And if we just look at these online acquisition part, what would be the acquisition cost and what type of products we offer to those customers acquired online. Any difference versus those traditional channels, like e-commerce, referrals and offer high promotions?",
        "And my second question is about the content adjustment. I just wonder what's the operational since we did on the first quarter that we'll be selling a notable interest income waive or discounts. And when we disclosed the APR calculated, does that include or it excluded this discount? Thank you very much.",
        "Jay Wenjie Xiao -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "Tony Hung -- Investor Relations",
        "So with regards again to the marketing costs, I think, again, I'd like to emphasize that we don't want to focus on a particular channel. We always want to have a diversified approach. We always want to reduce the concentration risk and that ultimately when we look at these situation, each channel has its benefits. There's advantages to each of the channels. And on the advertising, that we have done a lot recently, we've actually spent a lot of time on -- and effort in analyzing very, very carefully how to maximize the impact from the advertising. So as a result, we've been able to achieve relatively lower costs.",
        "A key part of this is based on our analysis, our ability to, in fact, through advertising attract 100 customers, which then may in fact lead to another additional 30 to 40 customers via referrals or other means. And as a result, this will keep our costs under 200 that may be per customer. So ultimately, when we look at the situation, yes, the advertising is definitely good. Yes, it's done very well for us. But we're not going to overly rely on this or any other channels. We're going to continue to analyze and work hard on developing all our diversified channels, including advertising, and do the advertising, also how it enables us to create from the advertising our customers, which then creates additional customers. So ultimately, it depends on the quarter. It depends on what's occurring in the market. We're going to adjust our approach accordingly. But again, if there's two things I want to emphasize, it's one, we want to have diversified sources. We definitely don't want to rely on any one or two single channels. And secondly, just as importantly, this needs to bring a long-term benefit. We need to have additional advantages resulting from each dollar that we spend on advertising that will give us a long-term ability to acquire even more customers.",
        "Jay Wenjie Xiao -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "Tony Hung -- Investor Relations",
        "So John, on your second question, I think it's worth pointing out that there were actually two adjustments, which, in fact, were different. First, there was, in the first quarter, the promotional events which occurred where unfortunately we didn't capture enough of the numbers effectively. So actually, after counting that in, then, yes, the effective APR would probably be a bit lower. Now, the second item or adjustment is for certain customers in the past where we've offered reduced expenses, APR fees or interest rate periods, we probably did not account for it as accurately as we could have. So hence, we had to make an adjustment for that as well.",
        "John Cai -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "So just want to follow up on -- for the customer we acquired online where we maybe offer them the first product, would it be any different as compared to -- for those customers we acquired from traditional channels in terms of interest rate, ticket size and tenor. Thank you very much.",
        "Jay Wenjie Xiao -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer",
        "[Foreign Speech]",
        "Tony Hung -- Investor Relations",
        "In regards to the question, I think online versus offline the initial offer, no real major difference. Tenor, probably about the same. APR probably about the same. Where there might be a difference is that the -- in terms of the amount of credit. It might be a little bit lower for online, because offline you do actually have the human face-to-face engagement. So other than that, really probably no real difference.",

        "NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The euro  fell below $1.10 on Friday to its weakest since May 2017 as a multi-day downward shift in the single currency intensified in afternoon trade.",
        "Traders had varied explanations for the drop, including thatmonth-end rebalancing of portfolios heightened an existing bias. The longer-term trend, which has seen the euro fall 0.90% in August, has been driven by an economic slowdown in Europe among other factors.  ",
        "The move also began shortly after President Donald Trump tweeted that the euro was dropping \"like crazy\" and lamented the state of the U.S. dollar, attributing its strength to Federal Reserve policy. A weaker dollar would send the euro higher, suggesting the tweet did not have a direct effect on the pair. The euro was last trading at $1.0976 against the dollar, down 0.71% on the day.",

      "text": [
        " I'll start by paraphrasing something I heard a physician say in a televised interview during the early days of some US states allowing medicinal use.  makeArticleAd();  When asked if marijuana could have medicinal value, he responded, \"For patients who have terminal conditions like cancer or AIDS, if marijuana eases their suffering, it would basically be barbaric to deny it to them.\"    \"Do I believe that some of the compounds present in marijuana plants could someday be the basis of clinically tested, FDA-approved pharmaceutical products in the future? Absolutely. Most drug compounds are derivations of plant compounds and there's no reason to believe that the marijuana plant might not also be valuable in that respect.\"    \"Would I advise a patient to light a plant on fire and inhale the combustants in unknown dosage in an attempt to cure an illness? Absolutely not, because that's simply not the way that the medical community administers any  medicine. We demand much more precision than that.\"    Those words were prescient, because although some of the early \"medicinal\" use was a thinly veiled attempt to make recreational use less illegal, marijuana has  become the basis for drug compounds that promise to improve the health outcomes of patients and produce profits for the companies who produce them.\u00a0   THC vs CBD    There is a crucial distinction to be made between Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD), the two primary active compounds in marijuana. (There are as many as 100 more cannabinoid compounds also sometimes present in the plant, based on the strain.)    THC is psychoactive and makes users feel high. CBD is not psychoactive and has no significant effect on mood or perception.    While some medical users also seek benefits from THC, it's CBD that has shown the most promise in the development of drugs.    There are whole families who have moved to states where Marijuana is legal in order to procure medicines that help their children. Specifically in the case of children who have certain forms of epilepsy that cause dozens of painful seizures daily, some strains of marijuana offer nearly immediate relief. These people quit their jobs, sold the house, pulled up the stakes and moved to Colorado to get drugs made from Cannabidiol - also known as \"CBD\", a non-intoxicating compound in marijuana - because they have been able to reduce or eliminate the seizures, even when other medicines and surgery could not.    Surely you can imagine that political beliefs about marijuana legalization get thrown right out of the window when someone is forced to helplessly watch their child or grandchild endure a painful seizure and relief is potentially within reach.    Continued . . .     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Pot Stocks to Buy on Tuesday     Pent-up demand released by wave after wave of marijuana legalization has created a new industry that is skyrocketing from $9 billion to an expected $32 billion in 2020. By 2025 it could reach $146 billion or more.    With Mexico likely to legalize marijuana use in October, the entire industry could surge higher.    Zacks launched a new approach to this space and quickly closed access to limit the number of investors who share its picks. Access has briefly re-opened but only until Sunday, September 1.   Get details right now >>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     This is exactly the type of apolitical momentum that might make legitimate medical marijuana medicines more accessible, even independent of the laws about recreational use. In fact, the most recent US Farm Bill, signed in December 2018, fully legalizes the production of hemp - a variant of the cannabis plant that has significant industrial and textile uses and contains extremely small amounts of the THC but can be harvested for CDB to make non-psychoactive drugs for both the pharmaceutical industry and the over-the-counter health and wellness industry. (More on this later\u2026)   The Drug Schedule    Under the Controlled Substances Act, all substances with the potential for addiction or abuse are placed into one of five \"schedules\" according to a combination of its potential legitimate uses and relative danger. Schedule 1 drugs have been deemed to have a high potential for abuse or dependency and no recognized medical applications. Marijuana is included in Schedule 1, along with LSD and heroin. In comparison, cocaine and opioids are Schedule 2 substances - not necessarily because anyone thinks they're less dangerous than marijuana, but because they do have recognized medical value.    Alcohol and tobacco were both intentionally left off of the controlled substances schedule - despite their potential for abuse/harm and lack of medical value - presumably because of the political influence of established industries.    It's widely believed (and supported by recordings of oval office conversations that became part of the Watergate scandal) that president Nixon lobbied for making marijuana a Schedule 1 drug with the explicit intention of harming groups that were not supportive of his politics and policies. In 1970 when the Controlled Substances Act was signed into law, anti-war protestors and minority groups were among the most common users of marijuana and Nixon took the opportunity to make their drug of choice as illegal as possible.    Recently, one of the biggest ongoing criticisms of marijuana prohibition is that minorities have been incarcerated for possession or use at a disproportionate rate based on demographics and use patterns. In a sense, the Nixon policy has remained stubbornly ingrained in present day law-enforcement.   CBD, the Farm Bill, the FDA and 7-11\u00a0    The most recent Farm Bill, signed in late 2018, broadly legalized the production and sale of hemp, which is defined as containing less than 0.3% THC but can be rich in CBD. It also de-schedules  CBD, paving the way for large-scale research and development.    This is great news for companies hoping to develop, test and sell CBD-based pharmaceuticals in the US, but it also creates a confusing situation in which products can now be sold virtually anywhere that contain CBD, promising all sorts of health and wellness benefits.    This is an important distinction. The investment opportunities are likely to be in true pharmaceutical research in which companies perform rigorous testing in controlled trials and report the results to the FDA for approval as a prescription drug, not in outfits that sell CBD products of uncertain strength and purity over the counter at convenience stores and make dubious claims about weight-loss, wrinkle reduction, etc.    It's not impossible that some of these purveyors will be able to turn a profit - gullibility is a powerful force and snake oil salesmen do profit sometimes - but it's not where we are going to focus our  investment research  efforts.    The FDA has been issuing warning letters to companies who make health claims about over-the-counter CBD products and will soon conduct public hearings about how the agency plans to regulate these products going forward.    In July, the FDA issued one such warning to cannabis retailer Curaleaf regarding potentially misleading claims about purported health benefits of CBD products that were included in its marketing. Curaleaf subsequently removed any such claims from its website and social media advertising.    While progress toward full legalization of marijuana in the US will have significant impact on companies who grow and sell it for recreational purposes, the floodgates are already open for the development of legitimate marijuana-based medicine.   Drug Pipeline?    Currently, one US listed company had an FDA approved drug with CBD as the main active ingredient - GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH). GW's Epilepsy drug Epidiolex received the lowest possible Schedule 5 classification from the DEA and GW has several other cannabinoid-based drugs in the R&D pipeline, including compounds for Multiple Sclerosis and Autism.    Incidentally, though insurers will probably pay less, the retail price for a year of treatment with Epidiolex is $32.5K, so there's also big money in CBD treatments with proven results. - The firs t report  ed quarterly results from GWPH that included some Epidiolex sales showed results which were quite promising. 4,500 patients were enrolled and 500 physicians dispensed prescriptions, leading to sales of $4.7M.    It has been getting even better.    In the next report (Q1 2019), which included the first 3 full months of 2019, sales of Epidiolex had increased 700% to $33.5M, with 1,900 physicians treating 7,600 patients. By the end of Q2, 2,500 physicians had prescribed Epidiolex to over 12,000 patients and revenues had grown to $68.4M. It's a remarkable growth story that illustrates the potential for cannabis-based drugs to penetrate the mainstream pharmaceutical industry.    The company also explained that\u00a0 93% of Americans are now covered by health plans that will pay for Epidiolex. GW's phase 3 trials for use in another seizure disorder - Tubular Sclerosis Complex - have been promising and fast-track \"Investigational New Drug\" (IND) phase 3 trials as a treatment for Rett's syndrome will begin in Q2.    Even more research from GW and many other companies is underway and health scientists are optimistic that cannabis will provide the basis of medicines for all sorts of diseases. The US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) announced in August that they would be streamlining the application process for the approval of growers who want to provide cannabis for research purposes.\u00a0\u00a0   Goodbye Opioids?    One of the most exciting pharmaceutical applications of cannabis is the development of replacements for deadly opioids in relieving pain. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that 400,000 Americans died between 1999 and 2017 from opioid overdoses. The State of Oklahoma was recently awarded a $572 million judgement as plaintiff in a lawsuit against Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) because of its role in manufacturing components for the drugs that are blamed for taking the lives of 6,000 Oklahoma citizens and uprooting the lives of many more who require extensive social services at the expense of the state.    There are currently thousands more lawsuits pending against numerous opioid manufacturers. Purdue Pharmaceuticals is currently proposing a $10-12 billion dollar settlement to end its financial exposure to the crisis.    New research is finding that CBD formulations can be as effective at relieving pain symptoms as opioid drugs, but with considerably less risk. Because it does not produce a perceptible psychoactive effect, CBD has a low potential for abuse. More importantly, even at high doses, it causes no acute health issues - no fatal overdoses have ever been reported.\u00a0    Though some consumers may use the current crop of recreational and medicinal cannabis products for pain, the real growth is likely to happen in pharmaceutical products that have been clinically tested for safety and efficacy and sold by prescription.    There are several big companies who are increasingly feeling a need to replace opioid drugs - from a lost revenue perspective as well as to improve public opinion. It's easy to see how a small pharma company with a cannabis-based replacement that has been approved by the FDA (or looks likely to be approved soon) would be very attractive as an acquisition target.    At Zacks, our focus going forward will be on monitoring that progress - from the idea stage all the way to the pharmacy - with the goal of recognizing the blockbuster drugs of tomorrow and investing early in that cycle.\u00a0   Best Way to Target Profits    Legalized marijuana - both medicinal and recreational - is skyrocketing from $9 billion in 2017 to an expected $32 billion within the next 2 years. Yet only a few growers, pharmaceuticals, financial firms, and suppliers - both established and start-ups - are the true innovators and offer exceptional profit potential.

        "McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) \u00a0has big news for its consumers. It's broadening its restaurant delivery service reach across the country with food delivery company DoorDash. In a recent statement , Chicago-based McDonald's stated that all 50 states and more than 10,000 stores will partner with San Francisco-based DoorDash to deliver all menu items nationwide. This deployment across the U.S. comes following a successful test period at 200 McDonald's restaurants in Houston, TX.",
        "\"At McDonald's, we're always working to enhance our customer's experience and offer new levels of convenience for our customers to get their favorite McDonald's menu items whenever and wherever they want by dining in our newly modernized restaurants, on-the-go through mobile order and pay, the drive-thru, or McDelivery. Since we launched McDelivery in the U.S. in 2017, we have seen customers respond well to the convenience and are excited for our customers to have the choice to use DoorDash, which is available in all 50 states and reaches 80 percent of Americans,\" said Bill Garrett, McDonald's senior vice president of operations.",
        "Image Source: McDonald's",
        "In July, DoorDash and McDonald's agreed on a delivery deal which led to the Houston experiment. Prior to joining forces with DoorDash, McDonald's had an exclusive delivery agreement deal with Uber Eats. That partnership ended due to frustration from McDonald's franchisees who were not happy with the financial agreements of the deal.",
        "According to Nation's Restaurant News , in a survey of 800 members who belong to McDonald's National Owner's Association,\" an overwhelming majority said they were not 'satisfied with the economics' and were in favor of McDonald's negotiating a better 'commission split' with third-party providers.\" McDonald's expects the food delivery industry to be a $4 billion business for its restaurants this year.",
        "McDonald's will also be available for those who subscribe to DoorDash's DashPass subscription program. This program offers subscribers free delivery on orders of $12 or more. DashPass is one of the fastest-growing subscription services in the country, set to soon pass 1 million subscribers. DoorDash is a private company.",
        "For investors, this delivery deal with DoorDash is better than finding a few extra McNuggets in your bag and the McFlurry machine working. McDonald's global average unit volume and cash on cash returns for new restaurants exceed most quick-service restaurant (QSR) chains. Throw in a dividend yield of more than 2% and a buyback plan for $22 billion to $24 billion from 2017 to 2019, and it's easy to see what makes the golden arches such an appealing stock to own.",
        "Sure, McDonald's carries some risks. Commodity price swings, wage inflation, foreign currency volatility, and the risk of foodborne illnesses can all affect quarter-to-quarter results, but McDonald's hasn't had to worry much as its stock is up more than 36% year to date and more than 132% over the past five years.",
        "Rather than resting on its laurels, McDonald's is staying ahead of the game. In the spring, it announced it would buy an Israeli-based company for $300 million \u00a0to implement digital touchscreen ordering menu boards in more of its restaurants and mobile order and pay options with a brand new curbside check-in option.",
        "McDonald's is investing in its employees' welfare as well.",
        "Starting in October, all 850,000 of its employees will undergo harassment training. The company said that 95% of its restaurant general managers and franchisees have already completed the training, which will now be implemented with rank and file workers. When it comes to establishing an all-around successful brand, McDonald's is doing just that. Investors who buy McDonald's stock today will reap the rewards of its dividends and steady growth while enjoying the future of food delivery.",
        "10 stocks we like better than McDonald's\r\n When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has quadrupled the market.*",

      "text": [
        "  Hackers were able to break into thousands of iPhones by   combining a number of iOS vulnerabilities, Google's Project Zero   security project revealed late Thursday. The hack was carried out   via dedicated websites; simply visiting those sites with an   iPhone    or iPad could result in hackers installing malware on those   devices, which they could then use to steal contacts, passwords   and other sensitive information. It's unclear how many devices were exactly affected by the   hack, but the number of potential victims could be high. \"We   estimate that these sites receive thousands of visitors per   week,\" wrote Project Zero team member Ian Beer   in a blog post Thursday evening.   Apple    didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.makeArticleAd(); The websites in question used to attack iPhones were up since   2017, and Beer wrote that the exploits his group found were   capable of breaking into devices running anything from iOS 10 to   iOS 12. Google's security researchers didn't discover the attack   until earlier this year. Before making their findings public,   they informed   Apple    , which closed the vulnerabilities with the release of iOS update   12.1.4 in February. Google did not share details about the sites in question this   week, but the wording of Beer's blog post suggests that they were   designed to target specific groups of users, perhaps ethnic   minorities, or opposition groups in a specific country. The   specifics of the hack \"indicated a group making a sustained   effort to hack the users of iPhones in certain communities over a   period of at least two years,\" Beer wrote. Apple's   iPhone    has long been seen as the most secure choice for end users; the   fact that the company controls both hardware and software has   helped it to more quickly respond to threats, and restrictions on   installing apps from third-party sources have made it harder to   trick users into opening up their devices to prying eyes. However, news of this massive hack shows that no device is   ever 100% secure, and that determined adversaries can always find   a way to circumvent security measures. Beer noted as much in his   blog post, and cautioned users who might be at risk to never   completely trust their devices to be secure, no matter the   manufacturer: \"Real users make risk decisions based on the public perception   of the security of these devices,\" he wrote. \"The reality remains   that security protections will never eliminate the risk of attack   if you're being targeted. To be targeted might mean simply being   born in a certain geographic region or being part of a certain   ethnic group.

        " One Starbucks grande Cold Brew with Salted Cream Cold Foam,   please. Even if your order sounds fancy, enjoying your coffee   shouldn't have to put you over budget. Whatever your drink of choice, following these tips could help   keep you from overspending at your favorite coffee spot - without   giving up your habit.makeArticleAd(); Write a money recipe First and foremost, recognize your Starbucks purchases as a   part of your actual   budget    . \"I prefer that people be realistic with themselves and say,   'Listen, this is a habit that I'm not going to give up. It makes   my day. It makes me happy,'\" says Marianela Collado, CEO and   senior financial adviser at Tobias Financial Advisors in   Florida. \"Then it should totally be a line item. If you take $5 a day   for 365 days, that's almost $2,000.\" Those who utilize a budgeting system like Mint or Quicken   should create a \"coffee fix\" category in their budget, Collado   says. This would fall under the \"wants\" section of your budget,   much like an entertainment or beauty category. And be sure to set   a monthly spending limit. Keep your dark roast out of the red Then, make some trade-offs. For example, Collado says she's   noticed that some members of her team regularly splurge on their   afternoon lattes, but bring their lunches to work instead of   going out to eat. They value getting coffee out more than they   value eating out. If you're not sure if you can hold yourself accountable on   your own, don't discount the ability of a gift card to keep your   spending on track. Using a gift card as your payment method is   actually a forced budgeting technique, according to Tracie Fobes,   founder of Penny Pinchin' Mom. She recommends loading a Starbucks gift card onto the   Starbucks app with your coffee money allotment for the month.   Then don't reload the card again for the next 30 days. \"You put $40 on that card, and when that $40 is done, guess   what? Your Starbucks run ends for the month.\" Swap stars for savings You can maximize your monthly coffee allotment by joining   Starbucks Rewards and downloading the coffee joint's app. The Starbucks loyalty program offers customers the ability to   earn stars - two stars for every $1 spent - that can later be   redeemed for free drinks and other rewards. There are also other   benefits, such as a free treat on your birthday, according to a   Starbucks spokesperson. If you're going to be making purchases at Starbucks anyway, it   makes sense to earn rewards for your loyalty - it'll stretch your   coffee dollars a little bit further. Brew up a bargain Loyalty programs are a popular   savings technique    (Starbucks told us its rewards program has more than 16.8 million   active members). But beyond simply joining, there are less   conventional ways to get the most out of your cup of joe,   too. One option? Time your coffee run strategically. The coffee   chain sometimes hosts discount promotions, such as happy hours.   These are deals offered directly through the Starbucks app and   could include offers such as 50% off drinks or buy one, get one   free. These are available to all Starbucks customers and   typically start at 3 p.m. At any time of day, try asking the barista for less ice,   recommends Kara Stevens, founder of The Frugal Feminista. The   beverage may be slightly less cold, but the container will be   filled with more drink for your money. Pass on the pastries Sure, you can keep the iced latte, but pass on the pricey   pastries, scones, cakes and other snacks, Fobes recommends. But if you really, really like the flavor of that iced lemon   loaf cake, go to Pinterest and check for a similar recipe you can   make at home. \"Somebody out there has a copycat where you can make it at   home and get the Starbucks experience without paying the   Starbucks price,\" Fobes says. Stevens puts her Starbucks food advice this way: Don't linger   too long. The more time you spend there, the more likely you are   to be tempted by the food items. With a little extra work, you can drink up your favorite   coffee with a helping of whipped cream - and without dragging   down your budget.

        " Now that prime minister Boris Johnson has announced his request to the Queen for the Parliament to be suspended a for a crucial five-week period  in ahead of Brexit, chances of a no-deal Brexit are pretty high on Oct 31. After all, a week after taking office, Boris Johnson pledged an additional \u00a32.1 billion  to prepare the UK to survive such a situation. So, it is prudent to analyze the impact on the UK and EU if a no-deal Brexit takes place.  Inside the No-Deal Brexit Procedure  In this scenario, the UK would instantly leave the European Union (EU) with no agreement  . Membership of dozens of EU bodies that oversee rules on everything from medicines to trade marks would be seized. And the UK would no longer be a contributor to the EU budget - currently about \u00a39bn a year  . It could be negative for UK trade as the UK government has already said \"most tariffs will be abolished for EU goods coming to the UK  , if there is no deal. But the EU doesn't have to do the same,\" an article published on BBC. Post break-up, the UK needs to be trading on WTO terms, which would also mean border checks for goods, which could cause a holdup at ports. Like other analysts, we too believe that higher import taxes and transport delays  would likely push up inflation. Bank of England governor Mark Carney already noted that in the worst-case scenario, UK shopping bills could rise by 10%, per BBC. Supermarket company Sainsbury's went on to highlight that the timing of the break-up - October - is all the more difficult as warehouse capacity normally runs short during this time of the year to stock up for Black Friday and Christmas. The BBC article went on to highlight that a no-deal Brexit could be detrimental to the UK service industry as it would lose all access to the EU single market.  What Lies Ahead of Pound ETF?  The future run of pound depends on whether the UK can clinch a good deal with EU in settling the divorce procedure. Per a forex analyst, \"sterling firmed to its best levels in almost a month  against the euro on Tuesday, as market participants grew increasingly optimistic that the UK would avoid a no-deal Brexit.\"However, with concerns coming back, things may not be too smooth for the pound ETF in the coming days. The pound came under pressure after the news of parliament suspension. Invesco CurrencyShares British Pound Sterling Trust FXB  is down 0.2% in the past month (as of Aug 28, 2019) and lost more than 0.6% on Aug 28.  What Waits For UK ETF?

        "Mallinckrodt shares sank earlier this week after\u00a0a federal appeals court ruled against the company in a patent infringement lawsuit. Investors also remain worried about Mallinckrodt's prospects in multiple opioid litigation cases. On Monday, Johnson & Johnson was ordered to pay $572 million in an Oklahoma lawsuit related to its opioid drugs.",
        "Perhaps the most disturbing news for Mallinckrodt is that Purdue Pharma is rumored to be considering settling all pending opioid litigation for between $10 billion and $12 billion. As part of this deal, Purdue would also file for bankruptcy.",
        "Image source: Getty Images.",
        "There are simply not enough reasons for even speculative investors to want to stick with Mallinckrodt right now. Should Purdue Pharma declare bankruptcy as part of a deal to settle its opioid lawsuits, there could be increased pressure on Mallinckrodt to reach a similar settlement.",
        "Keep in mind, however, that there's no certainty that any of these scenarios will occur. The rumors about Purdue Pharma haven't been confirmed by the company at this point. Purdue did release a public statement, though, stating, \"Purdue believes a constructive global resolution is the best path forward, and the company is actively working with the state attorneys general and other plaintiffs to achieve this outcome.\"",
        "Even if Purdue did reach a settlement and file for bankruptcy, Mallinckrodt could choose a different path. The circumstances for the two companies are quite different. Purdue is privately held. Its owners, the Sackler family, would still be very wealthy even if Purdue Pharma went bankrupt. Mallinckrodt, on the other hand, is a public company with a board of directors responsible for looking out for the interests of its shareholders. The company's opioid-related operations don't generate the majority of its total revenue.",
        "Mallinckrodt has more dark clouds lingering over it than Dracula's castle. The company wants to spin off its specialty generics segment but put plans for a spin-off on hold due to uncertainty created by the ongoing opioid litigation. Mallinckrodt said that it \"will consider all its available legal options\" with respect to the recent unfavorable patent ruling for its INOMax product, but there's no word yet on what steps the company will take.",

      "title": "10 Ways to Win at Fantasy Football and Options Trading - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "    You might assume that trading options and playing         fantasy football have very little in common, but you'd be         wrong. To start, both have become more mainstream lately;         more than 4.5 billion equity options traded in 2018,         marking an all-time high, according to data from the          Options Clearing Corporation           (         OCC          ). Plus, almost 60 million North Americans played          fantasy sports last year           , per the Fantasy Sports Trade Association. Still, the options and fantasy arenas can be scary         places for rookies. But have no fear; the keys to success         on both fronts are actually fundamentally similar. With the 2019 NFL season set to kick off soon, and         fantasy football fans (including myself and several of my         colleagues at Schaeffer's) busy with draft preparations, we         thought we'd examine the eerily parallel path to both         options-trading and fantasy victory. So, whether you're         about to embark on your options-trading journey or start         laminating your cheat sheets ahead of draft day, make sure         you obey these 10 Commandments:makeArticleAd(); Commandment 1: Thou Shalt Not Play If Thou Can't         Pay  Options          : Don't\u00a0          risk the capital           \u00a0if you can't afford to lose it. When playing with         options, you're\u00a0         going          \u00a0to have some losing trades along the way -- it's         inevitable. As such, it's not wise to wager bill money or         your life savings -- no matter what kind of \"hot tip\" or         \"good feeling\" you have beforehand. As Schaeffer's founder         and CEO Bernie Schaeffer says, \"Intelligent trading         decisions are rarely made when 'scared money' is         involved.\"  Fantasy Football          : Simply participating in a fantasy football league is fun.         However, it's even more fun when you win, obvs. Don't         be\u00a0         that guy\u00a0          dodging your dues -- it's not fair to the winner at payout         time, or the commissioner who has to take a baseball bat to         your knees. If you don't want to fork over the cash on         draft day, there are plenty of online leagues that let you         join for free. Commandment 2: Practice Makes Perfect  Options          : Before risking precious capital, try paper trading first.         Utilizing a virtual trading tool (provided by many                   online broker          s) allows you to test your trading knowledge, theories, and         risk tolerance to see which strategies work for you and         which don't. Make sure to take diligent notes in order to         analyze each trade's aftermath, which will help you         discover what kind of options trader you are and strive to         be.  Fantasy Football          : Before you head to (or log into) your league's live         draft, try a mock draft first (you can find a plethora of         free mock-ups online). The real deal can get pretty         intense, as there's often a time limit on how long you have         to make your picks (and please, for the love of all things         good, don't be the guy who takes the full two minutes).         Plus, not every round will go according to plan, so in the         words of Julie Chen, expect the unexpected. Commandment 3: Thou Shalt Not Play By the Seat of Thine         Pants  Options          : Research, research, research. It's crucial to examine a         security thoroughly before initiating an option trade. For         a multi-dimensional, well-rounded analysis, the         Schaeffer's\u00a0          Expectational Analysis          \u00ae\u00a0         methodology           \u00a0encourages investors to study a stock from         fundamental, technical, and sentiment perspectives.  Fantasy Football          : Research, research, research. While it's a rare feat to         know the stats of every NFL player, it's not smart to \"wing         it\" without doing your homework. Be as prepared as possible         before heading to the draft, and study a variety of cheat         sheets and analyses for a balanced outlook on prospective         players. And don't forget to check the injury reports --         and contract negotiations (looking at you, Melvin Gordon)         -- too. Commandment 4: Thou Shalt Consider Outside         Circumstances  Options          : On the same note as No. 3, it's essential for option         traders to be aware of outside circumstances that could be         a catalyst higher or lower for the stock. For instance,         before implementing an option play on stock XYZ, make sure         you check the company's corporate calendar. A significant         event like a date in the earnings confessional, or the         release of monthly sales figures, could potentially         impact\u00a0          option prices           \u00a0and your strategy.  Fantasy Football          : While a player could look good on paper, his performance         could be affected by circumstances outside his control.         Consider a team's strength of schedule, for example, or the         potential impact of a less-than-stellar quarterback on a         wide receiver. Also, if there are two relatively equal players         available when your draft pick comes around, let their         respective bye weeks be the deciding factor. If you've         already drafted two wideouts who'll be out Week 6, try to         avoid picking up another one with the same bye week.         Otherwise, you may be stuck scrounging for fourth-option         receivers on the free agent list mid-season. Commandment 5: Thou Shalt Do the Math  Options          : Before entering a trade, plot the numbers. You should be         cognizant of the breakeven levels, profit/loss potential,         and any commissions or margin requirements to best         understand where your play stands at any given time.  Fantasy Football          : Take note of your league's scoring system before the         draft. If your particular league awards more points for         running yards than receptions, you may want to consider         drafting a running back before a wideout. In the same vein,         if your league docks points for turnovers, Ben         Roethlisberger -- who led the league in interceptions last         year -- looks a little less tempting. Commandment 6: Thou Shalt Get What Thou Pays For  Options          : It's basic economics that an item in high demand will         command a higher premium. Options are no exception to this         rule. By comparing a stock's historical volatility to an         option's\u00a0          implied volatility           , you can gauge whether the option is relatively cheap or         expensive at the moment. However, seasoned option         speculators can take advantage of inflated premiums by         employing strategies like the short put or short call.  Fantasy Football          : In some fantasy leagues, you draft a player by outbidding         everyone else. In auction leagues, make sure to budget your         money before the draft, so as not to overspend on one         player early on and short-change yourself in the final         rounds. Commandment 7: Thou Shalt Hunt for Sleepers and         Busts  Options          : As contrarians, we like to find outperforming stocks         surrounded by skepticism. If the shares of an equity have         powered higher on the charts, but the Street still remains         leery, the unwinding of that pessimism -- in the form of         upgrades, price-target boosts, a short-covering rally, or a         reversal in sentiment in the options pits -- could all act         as catalysts even higher for the stock. On the flip side, contrarians also enjoy foraging for         underperforming stocks surrounded by optimism. If a         security is in the midst of a long-term downtrend, but the         Street remains bullishly biased, an unwinding of that         optimism could pressure the stock even lower as the bulls         abandon ship.  Fantasy Football          : Ahead of your draft, research undervalued players with         star quality, as they could be the next Kenny Golladay.         These often take the form of rookies or recently traded         players that tend to get drafted in the later rounds.         Meanwhile, don't waste a high draft pick on overvalued         players with little chance of making an impact. These busts         often turn out to be the aging or injury-prone players that         spend a large chunk of the season on the bench. Commandment 8: Thou Shalt Not Be Afraid to         Handcuff  Options          : Unsure about the future of a stock or particular sector?         Try hedging your bets\u00a0          pairs trading           . By simultaneously opening two related option positions,         you allow yourself a safety net to guard against an         unanticipated move in a specific sector. For example, to         hedge against potential weakness in the pharmaceutical         sector, an investor could buy a call on outperforming ZYX,         and simultaneously purchase a put on underperforming rival         XYZ. As long as the profits from one trade outweigh the         losses from the other, your pairs trade is money. Meanwhile, you can handcuff a long position with a short         position, if you want to reduce your risk on a single         stock. Shareholders of XYZ can \"handcuff\" their stake with         a\u00a0          protective put           , for example, while modestly bullish traders can initiate         a relatively conservative play on XYZ by executing a\u00a0          long call spread           .  Fantasy Football          : Unsure about the future of an injury-prone quarterback?         Or drafting a player facing suspension (looking at you,         Golden Tate)? Try hedging your bets with a handcuff. By         picking up the player's backup -- wait until the later         rounds, of course -- you can guard against season-ending         injuries or time off. Commandment 9: Thou Shalt Know Where Thou Stand  Options          : Don't be a passive investor -- ignoring your trades could         be fatal to your portfolio. Once you've initiated your         option play, it's vital that you keep close tabs on the         position. If you see that your position is tanking at a         rapid-fire pace, simply praying for a miracle often         exacerbates the losses. Instead, avoid clinging to losing         trades, and consider setting stop-loss levels to prevent a         massive deficit in your trading capital.  Fantasy Football          : Don't be a passive fantasy football player (unless you're         playing me that week...woo!), as not paying attention to         your lineup could cost you the win. As alluded to earlier,         being unaware of a player's bye week could leave a critical         void in your lineup. On that same note, pay heed to a         player's health status. If it seems like your kicker is         eternally on \"injured reserve,\" don't hesitate to drop him         for a player with fewer health concerns. Commandment 10: Thou Shalt Lose With Dignity  Options          : As mentioned earlier,\u00a0         all          \u00a0option traders will take a hit every now and again.         The trick -- besides proper allocation and portfolio         management -- is to take the losing trades in stride. Have         realistic expectations heading into every trade, don't let         fear or greed outweigh common sense, and -- most         importantly -- stay in the game.  Fantasy Football          : As much as it hurts to lose to your Great Aunt Linda,         remember that playing fantasy football is a game. Just as         no one likes a showboat, no one enjoys a poor sport, so         stay classy this season and, more importantly,\u00a0         have fun          . Good luck!    ",
        "   You might assume that trading options and playing         fantasy football have very little in common, but you'd be         wrong. To start, both have become more mainstream lately;         more than 4.5 billion equity options traded in 2018,         marking an all-time high, according to data from the          Options Clearing Corporation           (         OCC          ). Plus, almost 60 million North Americans played          fantasy sports last year           , per the Fantasy Sports Trade Association. Still, the options and fantasy arenas can be scary         places for rookies. But have no fear; the keys to success         on both fronts are actually fundamentally similar. With the 2019 NFL season set to kick off soon, and         fantasy football fans (including myself and several of my         colleagues at Schaeffer's) busy with draft preparations, we         thought we'd examine the eerily parallel path to both         options-trading and fantasy victory. So, whether you're         about to embark on your options-trading journey or start         laminating your cheat sheets ahead of draft day, make sure         you obey these 10 Commandments:makeArticleAd(); Commandment 1: Thou Shalt Not Play If Thou Can't         Pay  Options          : Don't\u00a0          risk the capital           \u00a0if you can't afford to lose it. When playing with         options, you're\u00a0         going          \u00a0to have some losing trades along the way -- it's         inevitable. As such, it's not wise to wager bill money or         your life savings -- no matter what kind of \"hot tip\" or         \"good feeling\" you have beforehand.

If you don't want to fork over the cash on         draft day, there are plenty of online leagues that let you         join for free.

Utilizing a virtual trading tool (provided by many                   online broker          s) allows you to test your trading knowledge, theories, and         risk tolerance to see which strategies work for you and         which don't. Make sure to take diligent notes in order to         analyze each trade's aftermath, which will help you         discover what kind of options trader you are and strive to         be.  Fantasy Football          : Before you head to (or log into) your league's live         draft, try a mock draft first (you can find a plethora of         free mock-ups online).

Be as prepared as possible         before heading to the draft, and study a variety of cheat         sheets and analyses for a balanced outlook on prospective         players. And don't forget to check the injury reports --         and contract negotiations (looking at you, Melvin Gordon)         -- too. Commandment 4: Thou Shalt Consider Outside         Circumstances  Options          : On the same note as No. 3, it's essential for option         traders to be aware of outside circumstances that could be         a catalyst higher or lower for the stock. For instance,         before implementing an option play on stock XYZ, make sure         you check the company's corporate calendar. A significant         event like a date in the earnings confessional, or the         release of monthly sales figures, could potentially         impact\u00a0          option prices           \u00a0and your strategy.  Fantasy Football          : While a player could look good on paper, his performance         could be affected by circumstances outside his control.         Consider a team's strength of schedule, for example, or the         potential impact of a less-than-stellar quarterback on a         wide receiver. Also, if there are two relatively equal players         available when your draft pick comes around, let their         respective bye weeks be the deciding factor. If you've         already drafted two wideouts who'll be out Week 6, try to         avoid picking up another one with the same bye week.         Otherwise, you may be stuck scrounging for fourth-option         receivers on the free agent list mid-season. Commandment 5: Thou Shalt Do the Math  Options          : Before entering a trade, plot the numbers. You should be         cognizant of the breakeven levels, profit/loss potential,         and any commissions or margin requirements to best         understand where your play stands at any given time.  Fantasy Football          : Take note of your league's scoring system before the         draft. If your particular league awards more points for         running yards than receptions, you may want to consider         drafting a running back before a wideout. In the same vein,         if your league docks points for turnovers, Ben         Roethlisberger -- who led the league in interceptions last         year -- looks a little less tempting. Commandment 6: Thou Shalt Get What Thou Pays For  Options          : It's basic economics that an item in high demand will         command a higher premium. Options are no exception to this         rule. By comparing a stock's historical volatility to an         option's\u00a0          implied volatility           , you can gauge whether the option is relatively cheap or         expensive at the moment. However, seasoned option         speculators can take advantage of inflated premiums by         employing strategies like the short put or short call.  Fantasy Football          : In some fantasy leagues, you draft a player by outbidding         everyone else. In auction leagues, make sure to budget your         money before the draft, so as not to overspend on one         player early on and short-change yourself in the final         rounds. Commandment 7: Thou Shalt Hunt for Sleepers and         Busts  Options          : As contrarians, we like to find outperforming stocks         surrounded by skepticism. If the shares of an equity have         powered higher on the charts, but the Street still remains         leery, the unwinding of that pessimism -- in the form of         upgrades, price-target boosts, a short-covering rally, or a         reversal in sentiment in the options pits -- could all act         as catalysts even higher for the stock. On the flip side, contrarians also enjoy foraging for         underperforming stocks surrounded by optimism. If a         security is in the midst of a long-term downtrend, but the         Street remains bullishly biased, an unwinding of that         optimism could pressure the stock even lower as the bulls         abandon ship.  Fantasy Football          : Ahead of your draft, research undervalued players with         star quality, as they could be the next Kenny Golladay.         These often take the form of rookies or recently traded         players that tend to get drafted in the later rounds.         Meanwhile, don't waste a high draft pick on overvalued         players with little chance of making an impact. These busts         often turn out to be the aging or injury-prone players that         spend a large chunk of the season on the bench. Commandment 8: Thou Shalt Not Be Afraid to         Handcuff  Options          : Unsure about the future of a stock or particular sector?         Try hedging your bets\u00a0          pairs trading           . By simultaneously opening two related option positions,         you allow yourself a safety net to guard against an         unanticipated move in a specific sector. For example, to         hedge against potential weakness in the pharmaceutical         sector, an investor could buy a call on outperforming ZYX,         and simultaneously purchase a put on underperforming rival         XYZ. As long as the profits from one trade outweigh the         losses from the other, your pairs trade is money. Meanwhile, you can handcuff a long position with a short         position, if you want to reduce your risk on a single         stock. Shareholders of XYZ can \"handcuff\" their stake with         a\u00a0          protective put           , for example, while modestly bullish traders can initiate         a relatively conservative play on XYZ by executing a\u00a0          long call spread           .  Fantasy Football          : Unsure about the future of an injury-prone quarterback?         Or drafting a player facing suspension (looking at you,         Golden Tate)? Try hedging your bets with a handcuff. By         picking up the player's backup -- wait until the later         rounds, of course -- you can guard against season-ending         injuries or time off. Commandment 9: Thou Shalt Know Where Thou Stand  Options          : Don't be a passive investor -- ignoring your trades could         be fatal to your portfolio. Once you've initiated your         option play, it's vital that you keep close tabs on the         position. If you see that your position is tanking at a         rapid-fire pace, simply praying for a miracle often         exacerbates the losses. Instead, avoid clinging to losing         trades, and consider setting stop-loss levels to prevent a         massive deficit in your trading capital.  Fantasy Football          : Don't be a passive fantasy football player (unless you're         playing me that week...woo!), as not paying attention to         your lineup could cost you the win. As alluded to earlier,         being unaware of a player's bye week could leave a critical         void in your lineup. On that same note, pay heed to a         player's health status. If it seems like your kicker is         eternally on \"injured reserve,\" don't hesitate to drop him         for a player with fewer health concerns. Commandment 10: Thou Shalt Lose With Dignity  Options          : As mentioned earlier,\u00a0         all          \u00a0option traders will take a hit every now and again.         The trick -- besides proper allocation and portfolio         management -- is to take the losing trades in stride. Have         realistic expectations heading into every trade, don't let         fear or greed outweigh common sense, and -- most         importantly -- stay in the game.  Fantasy Football          : As much as it hurts to lose to your Great Aunt Linda,         remember that playing fantasy football is a game. Just as         no one likes a showboat, no one enjoys a poor sport, so         stay classy this season and, more importantly,\u00a0         have fun          . Good luck!  ",
        " You might assume that trading options and playing         fantasy football have very little in common, but you'd be         wrong. To start, both have become more mainstream lately;         more than 4.5 billion equity options traded in 2018,         marking an all-time high, according to data from the          Options Clearing Corporation           (         OCC          ). Plus, almost 60 million North Americans played          fantasy sports last year           , per the Fantasy Sports Trade Association. Still, the options and fantasy arenas can be scary         places for rookies. But have no fear; the keys to success         on both fronts are actually fundamentally similar. With the 2019 NFL season set to kick off soon, and         fantasy football fans (including myself and several of my         colleagues at Schaeffer's) busy with draft preparations, we         thought we'd examine the eerily parallel path to both         options-trading and fantasy victory. So, whether you're         about to embark on your options-trading journey or start         laminating your cheat sheets ahead of draft day, make sure         you obey these 10 Commandments:makeArticleAd(); Commandment 1: Thou Shalt Not Play If Thou Can't         Pay  Options          : Don't\u00a0          risk the capital           \u00a0if you can't afford to lose it. When playing with         options, you're\u00a0         going          \u00a0to have some losing trades along the way -- it's         inevitable. As such, it's not wise to wager bill money or         your life savings -- no matter what kind of \"hot tip\" or         \"good feeling\" you have beforehand. As Schaeffer's founder         and CEO Bernie Schaeffer says, \"Intelligent trading         decisions are rarely made when 'scared money' is         involved.\"  Fantasy Football          : Simply participating in a fantasy football league is fun.         However, it's even more fun when you win, obvs. Don't         be\u00a0         that guy\u00a0          dodging your dues -- it's not fair to the winner at payout         time, or the commissioner who has to take a baseball bat to         your knees. If you don't want to fork over the cash on         draft day, there are plenty of online leagues that let you         join for free. Commandment 2: Practice Makes Perfect  Options          : Before risking precious capital, try paper trading first.         Utilizing a virtual trading tool (provided by many                   online broker          s) allows you to test your trading knowledge, theories, and         risk tolerance to see which strategies work for you and         which don't. Make sure to take diligent notes in order to         analyze each trade's aftermath, which will help you         discover what kind of options trader you are and strive to         be.  Fantasy Football          : Before you head to (or log into) your league's live         draft, try a mock draft first (you can find a plethora of         free mock-ups online). The real deal can get pretty         intense, as there's often a time limit on how long you have         to make your picks (and please, for the love of all things         good, don't be the guy who takes the full two minutes).         Plus, not every round will go according to plan, so in the         words of Julie Chen, expect the unexpected. Commandment 3: Thou Shalt Not Play By the Seat of Thine         Pants  Options          : Research, research, research.

        " Options          : Research, research, research. It's crucial to examine a         security thoroughly before initiating an option trade.

        " Fantasy Football          : Research, research, research. While it's a rare feat to         know the stats of every NFL player, it's not smart to \"wing         it\" without doing your homework. Be as prepared as possible         before heading to the draft, and study a variety of cheat         sheets and analyses for a balanced outlook on prospective         players. And don't forget to check the injury reports --         and contract negotiations (looking at you, Melvin Gordon)         -- too.",
        " Options          : On the same note as No. 3, it's essential for option         traders to be aware of outside circumstances that could be         a catalyst higher or lower for the stock. For instance,         before implementing an option play on stock XYZ, make sure         you check the company's corporate calendar. A significant         event like a date in the earnings confessional, or the         release of monthly sales figures, could potentially         impact\u00a0          option prices           \u00a0and your strategy.",
        " Fantasy Football          : While a player could look good on paper, his performance         could be affected by circumstances outside his control.         Consider a team's strength of schedule, for example, or the         potential impact of a less-than-stellar quarterback on a         wide receiver.",
        "Also, if there are two relatively equal players         available when your draft pick comes around, let their         respective bye weeks be the deciding factor. If you've         already drafted two wideouts who'll be out Week 6, try to         avoid picking up another one with the same bye week.         Otherwise, you may be stuck scrounging for fourth-option         receivers on the free agent list mid-season.",
        " Options          : Before entering a trade, plot the numbers. You should be         cognizant of the breakeven levels, profit/loss potential,         and any commissions or margin requirements to best         understand where your play stands at any given time.",
        " Fantasy Football          : Take note of your league's scoring system before the         draft. If your particular league awards more points for         running yards than receptions, you may want to consider         drafting a running back before a wideout. In the same vein,         if your league docks points for turnovers, Ben         Roethlisberger -- who led the league in interceptions last         year -- looks a little less tempting.",
        " Options          : It's basic economics that an item in high demand will         command a higher premium. Options are no exception to this         rule. By comparing a stock's historical volatility to an         option's\u00a0          implied volatility           , you can gauge whether the option is relatively cheap or         expensive at the moment. However, seasoned option         speculators can take advantage of inflated premiums by         employing strategies like the short put or short call.",
        " Fantasy Football          : In some fantasy leagues, you draft a player by outbidding         everyone else. In auction leagues, make sure to budget your         money before the draft, so as not to overspend on one         player early on and short-change yourself in the final         rounds.",
        " Options          : As contrarians, we like to find outperforming stocks         surrounded by skepticism. If the shares of an equity have         powered higher on the charts, but the Street still remains         leery, the unwinding of that pessimism -- in the form of         upgrades, price-target boosts, a short-covering rally, or a         reversal in sentiment in the options pits -- could all act         as catalysts even higher for the stock.",
        "On the flip side, contrarians also enjoy foraging for         underperforming stocks surrounded by optimism. If a         security is in the midst of a long-term downtrend, but the         Street remains bullishly biased, an unwinding of that         optimism could pressure the stock even lower as the bulls         abandon ship.",
        " Fantasy Football          : Ahead of your draft, research undervalued players with         star quality, as they could be the next Kenny Golladay.         These often take the form of rookies or recently traded         players that tend to get drafted in the later rounds.         Meanwhile, don't waste a high draft pick on overvalued         players with little chance of making an impact. These busts         often turn out to be the aging or injury-prone players that         spend a large chunk of the season on the bench.",

By simultaneously opening two related option positions,         you allow yourself a safety net to guard against an         unanticipated move in a specific sector. For example, to         hedge against potential weakness in the pharmaceutical         sector, an investor could buy a call on outperforming ZYX,         and simultaneously purchase a put on underperforming rival         XYZ. As long as the profits from one trade outweigh the         losses from the other, your pairs trade is money.",

By         picking up the player's backup -- wait until the later         rounds, of course -- you can guard against season-ending         injuries or time off.",
        " Options          : Don't be a passive investor -- ignoring your trades could         be fatal to your portfolio. Once you've initiated your         option play, it's vital that you keep close tabs on the         position. If you see that your position is tanking at a         rapid-fire pace, simply praying for a miracle often         exacerbates the losses. Instead, avoid clinging to losing         trades, and consider setting stop-loss levels to prevent a         massive deficit in your trading capital.",
        " Fantasy Football          : Don't be a passive fantasy football player (unless you're         playing me that week...woo!), as not paying attention to         your lineup could cost you the win. As alluded to earlier,         being unaware of a player's bye week could leave a critical         void in your lineup. On that same note, pay heed to a         player's health status.

        "It's understandable why the market is disappointed. Earnings per share are expected to grow only 9% this year. However, Ulta's model remains strong, and the company should capture an increasing share of the cosmetics market, especially as it benefits from changes in the retail industry .

        "The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of some improvement in the earnings outlook of constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions however, it appears that the improvement in this group's earnings growth potential hasn't been substantial. In the past year, the industry's earnings estimate for 2019 therefore shows a 23.6% decline.",

        "Revenue checked in at $1.25 billion during the second quarter, a 2.5% increase compared to the prior year's result and right in line with analysts' estimates. The 2.5% increase in revenue was slightly more impressive considering comparable-store sales checked in with only a 1.2% gain, lower than analysts' estimates of 1.9%. The discount retailer reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.53, which easily topped analysts' estimates of $0.40 per share.",

        "While management remains confident that its turnaround initiatives are working and that it has new strategies that will drive long-term growth, investors have yet to buy into the growth story. As you can see in the graph above, Big Lots has shed a little over half its value over the past year, which has driven its consensus forward price-to-earnings ratio to a meager six times. And even though the stock popped nearly 17% early Friday morning, the stock quickly gave up those gains as investors digested the information. On the bright side, its stock price decline has also boosted its dividend yield to an enticing 5.45%. If you believe in Big Lots' ability to fend off e-commerce competition, and you are interested in consumer goods retailers , the company offers a cheap valuation and juicy dividend yield, but management has work left to do on its turnaround.",

        "Veeva Systems (NYSE: VEEV ) just released its Q2 numbers and they were very good. The thing is, VEEV stock didn't really respond to its blowout earnings, revenue, and upbeat guidance.",
        "Why? Well, some of it has to do with the fact that VEEV stock is up 84% year to date. Analysts have been bullish on the niche cloud solutions provider for a while, so this great news didn't come from out of the blue.",
        "The stock is up over 1% today, but you need to bear in mind that VEEV stock is sporting a trailing PE of 89, so it's right in line with analysts' expectations. On the other hand, those expectations are high because VEEV has come to dominate a very important market sector.",
        "Basically, Veeva Systems has cloud-based software solutions for pharmaceutical, life sciences, and research companies that manage drug trials, research, as well as sales and distribution information. That includes content management systems that allow varied access of the sales side to the R&D side.",
        "Being able to share this highly proprietary data across an organization in a secure and efficient way is crucial. And building cloud-based systems specifically for the unique needs of this sector has allowed VEEV to build a groundswell of demand for its products.",
        "Remember that big pharmaceutical companies used to be vertically integrated behemoths, with massive internal structures. But increasingly, they have spun off divisions to companies that specifically focus on drug trials, product development, or manufacturing.",
        "All this subdivisions and subcontractors mean communications have become evermore important. And visibility is essential.",
        "According to a study by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, drug trials alone cost about $19 million . But according to a study by Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, the total cost of getting a drug to market, including R&D, production, marketing, etc, is around $2.6 billion .",
        "That's why it's crucial for companies to manage their resources wisely. And one of the keys to that is having real time information at their fingertips.",
        "Another point to bear in mind here is that VEEV stock isn't really affected by the bigger global issues that are tugging on other stocks right now. The trade war with China and the Brexit furor don't really change its growth path.",
        "The only thing that may change its trajectory would be a significant global slowdown or U.S. recession. But even then, healthcare is one of the more resilient sectors, especially as the populations of major industrialized countries are getting older and relying on more medications to boost the quality of their older citizens.",
        "What's more, animal medicines are also in great demand. For example, the African Swine Flu is having a major effect on pork production in Europe and Asia. Drug therapies to stem this quickly rising tide of infections is vital to these economies.",

      "text": [
        "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips",
        "Canada's Aurora Cannabis (NYSE: ACB ) is down over 45% from its 2019 high of $9.96, after sliding 0.54% to close at $5.55 on Thursday. ACB stock surged briefly earlier in August after the company issued a fourth-quarter update suggesting cannabis production for the quarter would be at the high end of its previous guidance, but its since given that back. In fact, at the current price it is approaching its 2019 low of $5.03.",
        "This makes ACB a tempting option for investors who are interested in getting in on the cannabis market. The company has been publicly traded for five years. And with a current production capacity in excess of 625,000 kilograms it's not just Canada's largest cannabis producer - it's one of the largest in the world.",
        "So, is ACB stock the one to choose? If so, is now the time to pull the trigger?",
        "There has been a huge increase in interest in the cannabis market over the past several years. Canada's legalization of recreational pot last fall resulted in a rush to buy. With production ramping up, it's turned out that some of these companies have been poorly run, resulting in a rash of corporate shakeups that have rattled investors.",
        "Aurora Cannabis has been a stable presence amid the turmoil. In operation since 2013, the company has a solid business in producing medical marijuana in addition to recreational cannabis products. It has invested in 15 global production facilities including the highly automated, 800,000 square foot Aurora Sky facility in Edmonton - capable of producing over 100,000 kilograms per year on its own. In addition, Aurora Cannabis has active operations in 25 countries.\u00a0",
        "It's worth checking on how ACB stock has performed relative to other stocks in the industry. Despite the steep drop since March, Aurora Cannabis has performed better in year-to-date terms, showing modest growth of 5.7%. In comparison, Canopy Growth (NYSE: CGC ) is down by 13% so far in 2019. For a real horror story, investors in CannTrust Holdings (NYSE: CTST ) - under investigation in Canada for illegal growing operations and one of the companies that fired its CEO this year - have taken a bath, with CTST down over 65% so far in 2019.",
        "In short, if you want to invest in a cannabis stock, you could do a lot worse than choosing ACB stock.",
        "The big wildcard here is Q4 earnings. Aurora Cannabis is expected to report in roughly two weeks and the results are going to have an immediate impact on ACB stock. As mentioned in the intro, the company already issued a Q4 update that puts its production for the quarter at the high end of previous guidance. That was a positive that resulted in a 10% surge for Aurora Cannabis stock, which hit $6.83. However, its guidance for Q4 net revenue in the $100 million CAD to $107 million CAD range was well below the $114 million CAD that analysts had been expecting. And there was no mention of earnings. It's been a downhill slide for ACB stock ever since.",
        "Depending on what gets announced when Aurora Cannabis delivers its Q4 earnings report, which should be before Sept. 15, ACB stock will be on the move.",
        "Despite a slow start, Canada's recreational marijuana sales have been picking up. In December the country will be legalizing edibles and other cannabis-infused products. Aurora Cannabis has been building up inventory to take advantage of this new market which could kick off another wave of growth among cannabis stocks. The long-term prospects for ACB stock seem good. More markets for its products are coming online. And, its investment in cutting-edge production facilities is poised to pay off.",
        "The big question remains whether to buy Aurora Cannabis stock now, or wait two weeks for those Q4 results. Among the nine analysts surveyed by Nasdaq , four currently have a hold on ACB stock, while two have it rated as a \"Buy\" and three call it a \"Strong Buy.\" It's a bit of a roll-the-dice situation, but now might just be the time to buy ACB. Even if it slides a bit after those Q4 results are in, it's a pretty safe bet for long-term growth.",
        "As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.",

Innovative Industrial Properties Inc (Symbol: IIPR) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most \"interesting\" ideas that merit further research by investors.    But making Innovative Industrial Properties Inc an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Friday, shares of IIPR entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $89.06 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Innovative Industrial Properties Inc, the RSI reading has hit 29.1 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel  currently has an average RSI of 48.2. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, IIPR's recent annualized dividend of 2.4/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.36% based upon the recent $101.66 share price.    A bullish investor could look at IIPR's 29.1 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on IIPR is its dividend history.

        "A company's own top management tend to have the best inside view into the business, so when company officers make major buys, investors are wise to take notice. Presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So in this series we look at the largest insider buys by the ''top brass'' over the trailing six month period, one of which was a total of $499K by Robert Holmes Swan, CEO at Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC).   Purchased Insider Title Shares Price/Share Value   08/28/2019 Robert Holmes Swan CEO 10,918 $45.70 $498,952.60      Swan's average cost works out to $45.70/share.

The current annualized dividend paid by Intel Corp is $1.26/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 08/06/2019.

        "Both types of retirement plans have potentially higher contribution limits than a traditional or Roth IRA. However, the higher option for you depends on your income, as these accounts have different methods of determining your annual contribution limit.",
        "Let's start with the SEP-IRA . This one is pretty straightforward: Self-employed participants can contribute as much as 20% of their gross income, up to a maximum of $56,000 in 2019. If you're 50 or older, the maximum is $62,000.",
        "The SIMPLE IRA is a bit more complicated. Self-employed individuals can contribute as much as $13,000 to their accounts in 2019, regardless of income, with an additional $3,000 allowance if you're 50 or older. In addition, you are allowed to contribute an additional \"employer matching contribution\" of as much as 3% of your salary.",
        "To show how this could work, let's consider two examples. For both, we'll assume you're under 50.",
        "If you're self-employed and earn gross income of $40,000 in 2019, you can contribute as much as $8,000 to a SEP-IRA in 2019. However, you can contribute $13,000 to a SIMPLE IRA plus 3% of your income for a total of $14,200.",
        "On the other hand, if you earn $200,000 in 2019, your SEP-IRA contribution limit will be $40,000, while your SIMPLE IRA maximum will be just $19,000.",
        "In short, if you're trying to save as much as legally possible, the SEP-IRA favors higher-income individuals while the SIMPLE IRA is the best option for lower-income savers. By calculating both limits for your income, you can determine the better option for you.",

        "It depends on what you're investing for and when you might need the money.",
        "An IRA -- either traditional or Roth -- is hands-down the best option from a cost standpoint. Not only will you not have to worry about dividend or capital gains taxes each year in these tax-advantaged retirement accounts , but you can also get a nice tax break for your contributions. With a traditional IRA, you can potentially deduct every penny you contribute, and a Roth IRA can give you tax-free income when you withdraw from the account.",
        "The caveat is that an IRA requires you to commit your money for a long period of time. There are a couple major exceptions, but you typically can't tap into your IRA until you're 59 1/2.",
        "If you're investing for a shorter-term goal, or you're just investing to get a feel for the market, a regular brokerage account could be best. You'll have to pay taxes on your dividend income, as well as taxes on any capital gains you earn each year, but it could still be the best choice if you need the flexibility to withdraw.",
        "One final thought is that a Roth IRA could be a good compromise. While a Roth IRA has the same standard withdrawal age as other retirement accounts, this only applies to the earnings in a Roth IRA. You're free to withdraw your original contributions at any time and for any reason, without paying a penalty.",

        "The company's new portfolio, which today is heavier on snacks and free from the weight that its Campbell Fresh segment had become, is predicted to deliver modest operating improvements over the next year.

Adjusted earnings are also on pace to rise between 2% and 4%, indicating a slight boost in profitability that builds on last year's 1% increase.",

        "Revenue in the fiscal second quarter grew 32% to $72.4 million, with gross margin contracting to 73.4%. The company attributed the reduced profitability to higher cost of revenue. That all translated into an adjusted net loss of $12.7 million, or $0.11 per share. That was slightly less red ink than the $0.12 per share in adjusted losses that analysts\u00a0were modeling for.",

        "Investors appear to be disappointed with Yext's guidance. The company, which utilizes a subscription model , expects fiscal third-quarter revenue to be in the range of $75.5 million to $76.5 million, shy of the $76.6 million in sales that the market was anticipating. Adjusted net loss per share is forecast at $0.18 to $0.19, compared to the consensus estimate of $0.13 per share in adjusted losses.",

        "The entire market has rallied in late August amid easing trade tensions, as both U.S. and China trade officials have said that the two countries are resuming trade talks. Since the favorable trade chatter started on Aug. 23, the S&P 500 , Dow Jones , and Nasdaq are all up about 3%.",
        "Marijuana stocks have not\u00a0 jumped along with the market\u00a0Shares of Aurora Cannabis (NYSE: ACB ) - one of the biggest companies in the Canadian cannabis market - have fallen since Aug. 23. This relative weakness is nothing new. Over the past three months, all three major indices have posted gains of around 4%-5%, but Aurora Cannabis stock is down more than 30% over that stretch. ACB stock has underperformed over the last six months, too.",
        "The underperformance of Aurora Cannabis \u00a0and all marijuana stocks\u00a0 indicates that investors' views of these equities have become so negative that not even stock market rallies have been able to save Aurora Cannabis from its multi-month slide.",
        "The long-term growth fundamentals of Aurora Cannabis stock, however,\u00a0 remain favorable. These fundamentals\u00a0 indicate that ACB stock can rise tremendously from today's depressed levels. But it's important to note that while fundamentals ultimately dictate long-term price movements, perception dictates near-term price movements.",
        "Thus, Aurora Cannabis stock increasingly looks like a \"near-term pain, long-term gain\" name. In the long-term, it can climb a great deal. But, until perception\u00a0 turns around, ACB stock won't rebound from this multi-month slide.",
        "The long-term growth fundamentals of Aurora Cannabis remain very favorable.",
        "The long-term bull thesis on ACB stock is based on three points. First, the global cannabis market will be huge one day. Second, Aurora Cannabis will be a sizable player in that gigantic market. Third, the price of ACB stock does not reflect its ability to turn into a sizable player in the soon-to-be huge cannabis market.",
        "On the first point, current consumption trends indicate that consumers don't just like to consume cannabis, but that they like to do so nearly as much as they like to smoke tobacco and drink alcohol. Due to changes in perception around the world,\u00a0 cannabis appears to be on a fast-track to global legalization. This combination indicates that the legal global cannabis market will one day be nearly as big as the global tobacco and alcoholic beverage markets. Those are multi-hundred billion dollar to trillion dollar markets.",
        "As far as the second point, Aurora Cannabis\u00a0 is the second-biggest player in the Canadian cannabis market today, behind only Canopy Growth (NYSE: CGC ). Thus, Aurora doesn't have to grow its market share over the next decade; it just has to defend its share. That seems doable, considering the company has been beating its peers over the past few quarters with huge volume growth, has a global distribution footprint that is second-to-none, and is one of the largest legal growers of cannabis in the world. Thus, Aurora\u00a0 should become\u00a0 a sizable player in the soon-to-be multi-hundred-billion-dollar global cannabis market.",
        "Moving to the third point, the global tobacco and alcoholic beverage markets have each spawned several $100 billion-plus companies, and many more $50 billion-plus companies. The cannabis market should do the same. ACB could very well be one of those $50 billion-plus or $100 billion-plus companies. Aurora Cannabis has a $6 billion market cap today. Thus, either way, ACB stock's potential upside in the long-run is huge.",
        "Although the long-term growth fundamentals supporting ACB stock remain favorable, the perception of ACB has become increasingly unfavorable over the past few months. Because perception drives near-term stock price movements, this deterioration has weighed on Aurora Cannabis stock.",
        "The unfortunate reality is that negative perception will continue to weigh on ACB stock for the foreseeable future.",
        "The current status of the cannabis sector is not pretty. Its volume and sales growth look fine. But the problem is that its growth is being driven by large investments. That is, everyone is spending a great deal\u00a0 on developing new products, building\u00a0 infrastructure, marketing to potential customers, etc. There has also been a great deal of price cutting across the sector.",
        "As a result, cannabis companies'\u00a0 margins are getting killed, and their cash is getting burned. That's a big problem for Aurora Cannabis. Unlike many of its peers, Aurora does not have a large balance sheet. It had less than C$350 million of cash at the end of last quarter. Over the last nine months, its operating business has burned through nearly C$200 million.",
        "Thus, ACB does not have a great deal of cash, and it's burning money at an alarming rate.\u00a0 In fact, given its spending,\u00a0 it's questionable how much longer the company can keep its doors open.",
        "But, in the big picture, I don't think this is an issue for ACB stock. Early leaders in young, high-growth markets frequently experience similar scenarios. They spend a great deal and burn through a lot of money in order to capture market share early-on, establish themselves as a market leader, and then reduce their spending as their market matures and rationalizes. Consequently, their profitability rises,.\u00a0 Aurora is following this playbook. which was also used successfully by Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). It will work for Aurora,\u00a0 too.",
        "But, this playbook is always accompanied by growing pains. Aurora Cannabis is in the middle of those growing pains right now. As long as those pains hang around, ACB stock will have trouble rallying.",
        "I like Aurora Cannabis stock's long-term outlook, because this company looks poised to become a sizable player in a multi-hundred billion dollar industry. It also has the potential to generate high profits after growing for awhile.",
        "But its bullish long-term outlook is being clouded by near-term growing pains. That is, in order to become prosperous in the future, Aurora has to spend a lot of money today. All that spending results in high cash-burn rates, which causes investors to freak out in the near-term.",
        "As long as these cash burn concerns persist, Aurora Cannabis stock will have a tough time rebounding. As a result, ACB stock looks like a classic case of near term pain, long term gain.",
        "As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\u00a0",

        "OTTAWA, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Canada's economy grew much more than expected in the second quarter, official data showed on Friday, providing a boost to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as he prepares to fight a tough re-election campaign in October.",
        "Statistics Canada said the economy expanded at an annualized rate of 3.7% in the second quarter, higher than the 2.3% the Bank of Canada had predicted in July and the 3.0% estimated by analysts in a Reuters poll.",
        "Polls show Trudeau's Liberals face a tight election race against the Conservatives, who have promised to make the economy and affordability a cornerstone of their campaign. ",
        "Trudeau came to power in 2015 promising to run modest budget deficits over four years as Ottawa invested more in the economy and boosted social spending.",
        "But the shortfalls are much larger than expected and the Liberals will not say when the budget will return to balance.   The Conservatives accuse the Liberals of reckless spending.",
        "Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the growth data showed the government's policies were paying off.",
        "\"Investing in Canadians works. Today's economic statistics confirm Canada's strong record of growth under our government,\" he said on Twitter. \"By making it easier for businesses to invest and putting more money in the pockets of hard-working families, we're moving Canada forward.\"",

        "Economists cautioned that the latest growth figures were unlikely to ease the central bank's worries, particularly those tied to continued global trade tensions, given much of Canada's second-quarter growth came from higher exports.",
        "\"There will be concern about how long that can last given escalated U.S.-China trade tensions, Brexit uncertainty and slower global growth,\" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada.",
        "June's gross domestic product rose 0.2%, the same as in May, marking the fourth consecutive month of increases, Statscan said, because of higher growth in the service-producing industries.",

        "      For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - August 30, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet GOOGL  , Facebook FB  , Twitter TWTR  , News Corp NWSA  and Apple AAPL  .  Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst   Blog:    Alphabet Roundup: Hong Kong News, Waymo, Privacy and     More   Being a big technology company is hard work these days. Not only must you satisfy regulators and police your own properties, but you must also keep producing newer and better innovations that will keep the dollars rolling in. Recent news on Alphabet shows it did all that and more. \u00a0  Hong Kong Influence Campaign Thwarted  Surprise! China, which doesn't allow American social media companies inside its borders, has been using platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter to spread a disinformation campaign to undermine the Hong Kong protests. Some protesters identified anti-protest advertising from state-run outlets like China Central Television, or CCTV. The social media companies found that the campaign in fact originated in mainland China and included posts that spoke of the protestors as dangerous and vile extremists. The trouble started with a new bill that would extradite Hong Kong people to Chinese communist courts. Although the Chinese government has since suspended the bill, the protests have now spread to a wider call for democracy. It's not unusual for China to annex territory that doesn't belong to it and then try to establish its hegemony there. Tibet is the best example. Interestingly, while Google followed other technology companies in removing about 210 YouTube channels involved in the campaign, it doesn't intend to change its ad policies or block China from the platform, although it has a policy of banning deceptive practices and inauthentic accounts. Technology companies generally have a system of educating governments about the use guidelines and they would like to leave it at that. Twitter is a refreshing exception because it has blocked advertising from regional state-controlled media. YouTube said that it would expand its labeling of state-backed media outlets in the region. It currently has a standard disclaimer on all government broadcasters across the world, so presumably it will now add Chinese newspapers like People's Daily, China Daily and Global Times. \"We are deeply concerned by Chinese attempts to manipulate public opinion by spreading disinformation about the situation in Hong Kong,\" a state department spokeswoman told Reuters. The Chinese government is pointing to a story in state-run media outlet People's Daily that says Facebook and Twitter \"abused media freedom\" by removing accounts revealing violence, while reserving comment on YouTube. Nice observation by a government that censors every bit of news in the country.  Google Has Competition With News Corp As News   Aggregator  More competition is always a good thing, if the plans come to fruition. But the story that the WSJ is spinning about its parent company News Corp starting a new aggregation service may not end that way, according to the Journal itself. But there's a good bit of detail on the service, so it may not be just a tool to gain leverage with current partners Facebook and Google. For one, it will include hundreds of sources, including national outlets, digital publications, magazines and local newspapers, from which it won't take a share of ad revenue. Ahem. Apps are also in the cards, and could launch as early as \"later this year\". It will use both algorithmic and human curators. We also know that this is going to be a news service that gives equal treatment to small and big publishers, to paid and free outlets, and to democrats and republicans, or conservatives and otherwise. We'll see how that goes.  A New Privacy Plan  Google is suggesting a new approach to how you're tracked on the web that essentially restricts the amount of your information that is shared on the Internet so your anonymity is maintained. The thinking is that this can be achieved if personally identifiable data is stored on the device rather than the browser, cryptographic tokens are used to confirm a person's identity and artificial intelligence is used to deliver targeted ads. Google is obviously against the removal of cookies altogether because that will affect revenues for both publishers and itself. It also won't solve the problem because developers can use other means to track you. Those are the reasons it has opposed the measures taken by Apple and Mozilla on their browsers. Google has around 70% of browser market share, so although it wants some standard practices, which is a good thing, it will obviously play a leading role in how those standards are determined.  Actions To Protect Kids  Google's YouTube recently took a couple of measures for the protection of children using the platform. This is a welcome move and may have been prompted by the FTC investigation into its possible violation of the Children's Online Privacy Act (COPPA) and how it happened to allow a group of pedophiles to operate on the platform through its messaging feature. And sure enough, when the company announced its decision to remove private messaging on YouTube, the group of people making the most noise were children who were somehow restricted from using phones or sharing phone numbers, or using a\u00a0 social networking platform. This was a way for them to connect with their online friends while remaining undetected by their parents. YouTube is also saying it won't send targeted ads at videos likely to be watched by kids. But this isn't being well-received because some groups want it to remove all videos that are likely to be watched by kids and divert all kids to the ad-free YouTube for Kids app. They also oppose YouTube's collection of kids' data to build a database and target ads at them either now or in the future.  Waymo Developments  There are two bits of news surrounding Waymo and both are interesting. The first is a decision by Waymo principal scientist and head of research, Drago Anguelov to open up its data set for research by outsiders. Once they buy a standard license, they will have access to the extensive, organized (categorized and labelled) data that Waymo has gathered by virtue of being one of the first companies to start out in this effort. The goal appears to be to hasten R&D in the space by attracting PhD students, academics and professors to the dataset to help it solve some of its problems. Anguelov says, \"Mostly we're trying to get others into thinking about our problems and working with us, as opposed to doing work that's potentially not so impactful, given the current state of things.\" But it can also be licensed to independent research labs, robotics labs and research teams at even its competitors. The second is Uber testing its cars in very heavy rain. The test cars are therefore heading to public roads in Florida and include highway driving to Orlando, Tampa and Fort Myers. Given that weather conditions can be severe due to hurricanes, the cars will be driven by humans to collect data with laser and radar sensors.

        "  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - August 30, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: ExxonMobil XOM  , Chevron CVX  , ConocoPhillips COP  , Valero Energy VLO  and Marathon Petroleum MPC  ..  Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst   Blog:    Oil Rises After EIA Reports Bullish Surprise on All     Fronts   Oil prices rose back above $55 a barrel, after U.S. government data showed a crude stockpile draw twice above expectations. The decline in oil inventories was the largest in the U.S. in five weeks, and came in tandem with a fall in gasoline and distillate supplies. It remains to be seen whether the positive report changes the narrative of the oil market that was in bear territory just weeks ago amid fears of a global economic slowdown in the backdrop of the U.S.-China trade war.  Analysis of the EIA Data    Crude Oil:   The federal government's EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 10 million barrels for the week ending Aug 23, compared to the 4.7 million barrels drawdown that energy analysts had expected. A combination of lower imports and higher exports largely drove the massive stockpile decline with the world's biggest oil consumer. This puts the total domestic stocks at 427.8 million barrels - 5.4% above the year-ago figure and in line with the five-year average. Oil prices drew further support from stockpile draw at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma. The key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange saw inventories decline 2 million barrels to 40.4 million barrels - the lowest since December.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The crude supply cover was down from 25.1 days in the previous week to 24.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 22.9 days. Turning to products, and it is a fairly bullish story.   Gasoline:   Gasoline supplies fell 2.1 million barrels as demand for the fuel increased by 274,000 barrels per day to 9.9 million barrels per day. Analysts had forecast 530,000 barrels decline. At 232 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is unchanged from the year-earlier level but exceeds the five-year average range by 3%.   Distillate:   Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) were down 2.1 million barrels last week on lower production and higher demand, while analysts were looking for an inventory addition of 700,000 barrels. Current supplies - at 136.1 million barrels - are 4.7% higher than the year-ago level though stocks remain 4% below than the five-year average.   Refinery Rates:   Refinery utilization was down 0.7% from the prior week to 95.2%.  About the Weekly Petroleum Status Report  The Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad. The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current  oil prices  and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry. The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips - all carrying Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) - and refiners such as Valero Energy and Marathon Petroleum. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank   (Strong Buy) stocks here   .  Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit   Potential  The biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases.

        "      For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - August 30, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Netflix NFLX  , Amazon AMZN  , Apple AAPL  , Alphabet GOOGL  and Facebook FB  .  Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst   Blog:    FAANG 52-Week Laggard: Facebook the One Bright Spot?   FAANG, as an aggregate, has been underperforming the broader market over the past 52-weeks with only one stock illustrating positive returns. Over the past 12 months, Netflix shares lost 19.4%, Amazon is down 10.5%, Apple shares fell 7.7%, and Alphabet is down 4.7%. Facebook, the one bright spot in FAANG, has been able to return shareholders 3.9% in the last 52-weeks. Why have the treasured FAANG stocks been lagging in recent months of trading? Has the growth stopped, is this just function of valuation or can the recent soft performance be understood on an individual basis? I discussed a couple of FAANG stocks that appear to have some fundamental flaws in my article Is FAANG Losing Its Allure?  Below I'm going to discuss the strongest FAANG stock over the past 52-weeks and if it has the aptitude to continue its drive.  Facebook  Facebook has illustrated an unprecedented topline growth averaging over 50% year-over-year, and never falling under 26% quarterly expansion since FB went public 7 years ago. Analysts are expecting the company to expand its revenue by 26% and 22% this year and next, respectively. Facebooks user growth appears to know no end with relentless quarter-over-quarter improvements in monthly active users (MAUs). There are currently over 2.4 billion humans who use Facebook on a monthly basis, and this doesn't include its other portfolio services like Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus. This means that over 50% of the internet accessing world check their Facebook account at least once a month. If Instagram and WhatsApp were added to this figure, the penetration would be closer to 100%. User growth is soon going to be a product of world population growth, but this is not going to slow the firm's growth. The company has been able to increase average revenue per user (ARPU) year-over-year consistently.  Libra  Now Facebook is preparing to take a plunge into the financial market with its development of a cryptocurrency. Facebook is partnering with 28 other firms ranging from financial service companies to ride-sharing firms like Uber in the Libra Association. Libra is going to be quite different from other cryptocurrencies for several reasons. One, it's not entirely decentralized, it puts its confidence in the 28 accredited members of the Libra Association who will act as the \"central bank\" of the coin. This will hinder illegal activity with the currency. Libra is also going to be backed by a basket of currencies and US treasuries making it a \"stable-coin\". Being asset-backed, Libra won't have the volatility of bitcoin or ethereum, and owners will have the comfort of being backed by real assets. This project could be a very profitable endeavor for FB if it can properly execute its new digital wallet for Libra, Calibra. This wallet will be available to anyone with an internet connection. Libra will be accessible in Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and as a standalone app. Facebook, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp are the top three downloaded smartphone apps giving this financial services access and tremendously large consumer base right out of the gates. Libra could become the international currency that changes the financial markets.  Valuation  FB's forward P/E has dropped substantially over the last 5 years, from its high of 61x in 2015 to the 21.5x that it is trading at today. This is an inevitable trend as the firm matures and the excessive growth decelerates. If Libra takes off globally when it is released next year, I am confident that FB will be thrown right back into high growth multiples.  Take Away  If you are a believer in Facebooks stable-coin, Libra, FB is a buy right now. Libra aside, FB still has a convincing narrative with reasonable multiples. It continues to prove me wrong about its ability to see relentless user growth, and I am done fighting the trend. FB has run up over 40% in 2019 so far, but it is still over 15% off its 2018 highs. If Facebook can avoid any further regulatory run-ins and it can continue its consistent ARPU growth, I am certain that it will make new highs.

        "  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - August 30, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY  , Alamos Gold Inc. AGI  , Americold Realty Trust COLD  , TransDigm Group Inc. TDG  and frontdoor Inc. FTDR  .  Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst   Blog:    5 Top Momentum Stocks in August Despite Market Mayhem   Wall Street is on the verge of completing its most-disastrous month so far this year. Volatility resurfaced in Wall Street since the beginning of August after two months of bull run. A less-than-expected dovish monetary stance taken by the Fed in its FOMC meeting at July end, heightened tariff war between United States and China, the global economic slowdown, especially in manufacturing and, exports together with frequent inversion of the main yield curve of the U.S. Treasury Notes, resulted in a stock market rout. The three major stock indexes ---- the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite --- have so far lost 3.1%, 3.1% and 3.9%, respectively, in August. Despite these negatives, a few stocks have surged in the past month and still carry strong momentum for further upside.  U.S.-China Trade Conflict Intensified  On Aug 23, China announced that it will impose 5% to 10% tariff on another $75 billion of U.S. goods in two tranches, on Sep 1 and Dec 15. Additionally, a 25% tariff on U.S. auto products and auto parts will be imposed effective Dec 15. In retaliation, President Donald Trump decided to raise tariff to 30% from the existing 25% on $250 billion Chinese goods. Moreover, he also raised the tariff from 10% to 15%, which is to be levied on an additional $300 billion of Chinese exports effective Sep 1. Consequently, tariff on $550 billion Chinese goods will cover total U.S. imports from China per annum. Furthermore, Trump tweeted by issuing an order to U.S. companies to look for an alternative to China for their operations including returning home. President Trump also hinted that prolonging the U.S.-China trade conflict can lead to the imposition of national emergency, though not immediately.  Global Headwinds  The GDP of the Eurozone economy as a whole declined to 0.2% in the second quarter compared with 0.4% in the first. Notably, Germany, the fourth-largest economy in the world, witnessed a 0.1% contraction in its second-quarter 2019 GDP, the first time since the third quarter of 2018. Germany's industrial output in July also declined 5% year over year. The German Ifo Institute reported that business sentiment in July came in at a reading of 94.3, the lowest level since November 2012. The second-quarter 2019 GDP of the U.K. contracted 0.2% for the first time since late 2012. The manufacturing sector declined 2.3% in the second quarter, marking its biggest quarterly fall since the first quarter of 2009. Moreover, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson decided to suspend the parliament until Oct 14, raising the concern of no-deal Brexit as Britain is scheduled to exit from the European Union on Oct. 31. In China, industrial output grew 4.8% in July, marking its lowest growth in more than 17 years. Retail sales in China were up 7.6% in July, reflecting the second-lowest rate of growth since 2003. Meanwhile, political unrest for democracy heightened in Honk Kong, the financial hub of Asia. Hong Kong's close financial proximity with Europe and several Asian emerging markets may result in global financial turmoil if political unrest continues for an indefinite time period.  5 Top Momentum Stocks Flying High in August  We have narrowed down our search to five such stocks, which popped in August and still have strong momentum.

        "By Saikat Chatterjee",
        "LONDON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The pound extended gains against the euro on Friday, putting it firmly on track for its biggest monthly rise since February as a broad-based drop in the single currency against its rivals encouraged investors to buy the British unit.",
        "The euro fell more than 0.5% drop against the Japanese yen  and the Australian dollar , but the pound's gains against the single currency were contained as investors braced for a tense opening to the British parliament next week.",
        "The opposition Labour Party said this week it would trigger an emergency parliamentary debate next week to try to stop Johnson taking Britain out of the European Union without a withdrawal deal. ",
        "Some of the moves in the pound were partly exaggerated in typical Friday afternoon trading.",
        "\"Though the threat of a no-deal Brexit is higher than before, extreme short positioning has been partially the reason for its strength and also some investors see value in the pound around these levels,\" said Neil Mellor, a senior FX strategist at BNY Mellon in London.",
        "Some money managers even sense an opportunity, believing the British currency is cheap, and the government's gambit could make clinching a new withdrawal deal with the EU more likely. ",
        "Versus the euro , the pound gained 0.4% to 90.38 pence. On a monthly basis, the pound is set to rise 0.8%, its biggest monthly rise since February against the euro.",
        "On a weekly basis, the British currency is set for a third consecutive weekly rise versus the euro.",
        "Despite this week's events, most big banks still see a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31 as an unlikely outcome. Some such as JP Morgan assess that probability at 35% - up from a previous 25% - while others such as Nomura and Deutsche Bank put it at between 40%-50%.",
        "UBS Wealth Management believes the market is pricing in a higher probability of around 50% for a no-deal Brexit which UBS considers too high, prompting the money manager to be tactically bullish on the pound versus the greenback.",
        "The median forecast for a disorderly Brexit - whereby no deal is agreed - jumped in an Aug. 2-7 Reuters poll of economists to 35%, up from 30% given in July and the highest since Reuters began asking this question two years ago. ",
        "Against the dollar , the pound was broadly steady at $1.2173 and not far away from a 2-1/2 year low of $1.2015 reached earlier this month."

        "      For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - August 30, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY  , ONEOK Inc. OKE  , Verizon Communications Inc. VZ  , Principal Financial Group Inc. PFG  and Omnicom Group Inc. OMC  .  Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst   Blog:    Can the Treasury Yield Inversion Benefit Stocks? 5 \"Yes\"     Answers to That   Wall Street is currently reeling under the inverted yield curve of U.S. Treasury Securities. The bond market scenario, which showed its ugly face on Aug 14, has worsened thereafter compelling several economists and financial experts to warn for a possible recession in the U.S. economy. However, there still exists a ray of hope even under a cloudy financial market landscape. On Aug 27, Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, pointed out that yield on long-term, 30-year U.S. Treasury Note has fallen even below the dividend yield of the S&P 500 Index, popularly known as the benchmark index of equities.  Stock-Bond Yield Inversion Likely to Benefit   Investors  On Aug 27, the yield on long-term, 30-year U.S. Treasury Bond fell to 1.916%, below the S&P 500's dividend yield of an estimated 1.94%. However, the yield on the 30-year Note later stabilized at 1.961%. Again, on Aug 28, the yield on 30-year Note sild to its all-time low of 1.907% and recovered only to 1.942% at the closing of the day. The inversion of long-term government yield with the dividend yield of the broad-market index of equities is likely to make equities more attractive alternatives. Intensifying trade conflict with China and fear of a global economic slowdown, especially in Eurozone and China, have significantly dented investors' confidence. However, in their rush to pour money to safe-haven government bonds from risky equities, market participants have shifted too much money to the bond market resulting in plunging yields. At this juncture, any company, which has a history of paying out regular dividend, with higher dividend yield than the yield of 30-year U.S. Treasury Note, will be a more preferable asset for investors.  Is Recession Impending or Overblown?  On Aug 14, yield on the benchmark 10-year Note dropped to 1.623%, which fell below the 2-year Note's yield of 1.634, for the first time since December 2005. Thereafter, the situation worsened further. On Aug 28, yield on the 10-year Note plummeted below the psychological barrier of 1.5% to 1.45%, below the 2-year Note's yield of 1.5%. The spread registered its lowest level since 2007. Meanwhile, the yield on short-term 3-month Treasury Bill stayed at 1.992%, reflecting inversion with the yields of mid-term 2-year, benchmark 10-year and long-term 30-year Notes. In fact, inversion between 3-month and 10-year bond yield is continuing since March 2019. At present, this inverted spread is for more than 54 basis points, its highest since March 2007. The yield curve of government bonds are generally upward sloping, implying that a higher rate of interest is needed for individuals to hold longer maturity bonds. However, an inverted yield curve is generally characterized as market's diminishing expectations about future economic growth. CNBC stated that since 1978, there were five yield inversions between 2-year and 10-year Notes, all of which led to a recession. However, several economists and financial experts have pointed out that the fundamentals of the U.S. economy are still strong to cope with any recessionary signal. While some economic data, especially for the manufacturing sector, indicated that business investment has slowed down due to a lingering tariff war, several consumer-centric data like consumer confidence and retail sales clearly highlighted economic stability. Moreover, the U.S. labor market remained simply robust with strong job additions, steady wage growth and record-low unemployment. Meanwhile, the second-quarter 2019 results were far better than expected at the beginning of the reporting cycle, albeit with a dip in profit margin.  Our Top Picks  At this stage, investment in high-yielding, S&P 500 stocks which pay out regular dividend will be a prudent move. However, the selection process may be difficult.

        "  Can the Treasury Yield Inversion Benefit Stocks? 5 \"Yes\"     Answers to That  ",
        "Wall Street is currently reeling under the inverted yield curve of U.S. Treasury Securities. The bond market scenario, which showed its ugly face on Aug 14, has worsened thereafter compelling several economists and financial experts to warn for a possible recession in the U.S. economy.",
        "However, there still exists a ray of hope even under a cloudy financial market landscape. On Aug 27, Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, pointed out that yield on long-term, 30-year U.S. Treasury Note has fallen even below the dividend yield of the S&P 500 Index, popularly known as the benchmark index of equities.",
        " Stock-Bond Yield Inversion Likely to Benefit   Investors ",
        "On Aug 27, the yield on long-term, 30-year U.S. Treasury Bond fell to 1.916%, below the S&P 500's dividend yield of an estimated 1.94%. However, the yield on the 30-year Note later stabilized at 1.961%. Again, on Aug 28, the yield on 30-year Note sild to its all-time low of 1.907% and recovered only to 1.942% at the closing of the day.",
        "The inversion of long-term government yield with the dividend yield of the broad-market index of equities is likely to make equities more attractive alternatives. Intensifying trade conflict with China and fear of a global economic slowdown, especially in Eurozone and China, have significantly dented investors' confidence.",
        "However, in their rush to pour money to safe-haven government bonds from risky equities, market participants have shifted too much money to the bond market resulting in plunging yields. At this juncture, any company, which has a history of paying out regular dividend, with higher dividend yield than the yield of 30-year U.S. Treasury Note, will be a more preferable asset for investors.",
        " Is Recession Impending or Overblown? ",
        "On Aug 14, yield on the benchmark 10-year Note dropped to 1.623%, which fell below the 2-year Note's yield of 1.634, for the first time since December 2005. Thereafter, the situation worsened further. On Aug 28, yield on the 10-year Note plummeted below the psychological barrier of 1.5% to 1.45%, below the 2-year Note's yield of 1.5%. The spread registered its lowest level since 2007.",
        "Meanwhile, the yield on short-term 3-month Treasury Bill stayed at 1.992%, reflecting inversion with the yields of mid-term 2-year, benchmark 10-year and long-term 30-year Notes. In fact, inversion between 3-month and 10-year bond yield is continuing since March 2019. At present, this inverted spread is for more than 54 basis points, its highest since March 2007.",
        "The yield curve of government bonds are generally upward sloping, implying that a higher rate of interest is needed for individuals to hold longer maturity bonds. However, an inverted yield curve is generally characterized as market's diminishing expectations about future economic growth. CNBC stated that since 1978, there were five yield inversions between 2-year and 10-year Notes, all of which led to a recession.",
        "However, several economists and financial experts have pointed out that the fundamentals of the U.S. economy are still strong to cope with any recessionary signal. While some economic data, especially for the manufacturing sector, indicated that business investment has slowed down due to a lingering tariff war, several consumer-centric data like consumer confidence and retail sales clearly highlighted economic stability.",
        "Moreover, the U.S. labor market remained simply robust with strong job additions, steady wage growth and record-low unemployment. Meanwhile, the second-quarter 2019 results were far better than expected at the beginning of the reporting cycle, albeit with a dip in profit margin.",
        " Our Top Picks ",
        "At this stage, investment in high-yielding, S&P 500 stocks which pay out regular dividend will be a prudent move. However, the selection process may be difficult. Our VGM Score  will come in handy to select proper stocks.",

      "title": "Lululemon Earnings: What to Watch - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "Investors have rewarded lululemon athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) for its strong growth over the last year. Shares are up almost 50% so far in 2019, with the company having blown past management's growth targets in each of the last five quarters.",
        "That impressive track record implies good news when the apparel chain reports fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday, Sept. 5. But investors have a few concerns heading into that announcement, especially around cost and demand trends for the back half of the year.",
        "Image source: Getty Images.",
        "Lululemon has been gobbling up market share in both its online and brick-and-mortar selling channels, and those gains are likely to continue. Following a 22% revenue spike last quarter, and 24% growth for the full 2018 fiscal year, management predicted sales will rise to about $830 million in the second quarter, or 15% above last year's result. Most investors who follow the stock are predicting another beat, though, with Wall Street pros targeting sales of $845 million on average.",
        "The company is facing stepped-up competition from rivals like Nike (NYSE: NKE) , and it is increasingly pushing into new categories such as outerwear. Another strong sales quarter would show that CEO Calvin McDonald and his team have the right strategies in place to deal with these challenges. As usual, look for e-commerce to lead the way higher given that this channel soared 60% last quarter and is responsible for over one-quarter of annual sales .",
        "CFO Patrick Guido warned investors in June to expect some soft profitability results this quarter. The company had noticed spiking shipment activity due to increasing tariff rates, and it responded to the backlog by moving some of its supply to air freight rather than shipping freight. We'll find out on Thursday how that move affected gross profit margin.",
        "The longer-term trend is clearly positive on this score, though. Gross margin has improved by over 7 percentage points since 2015, and executives have predicted several more years of steady gains here thanks to the combination of several positive trends. These include the shift toward online selling; a tilt toward Lululemon's latest, high-margin product releases, and the chain's increasing economies of scale.",
        "Lululemon lifted its full-year outlook following last quarter's results, but the boost was conservative given the blockbuster results to start the year. Management sees sales landing between $3.73 billion and $3.77 billion, which was below the $3.8 billion that Wall Street pros were predicting. Investors' expectations haven't changed in the last few months, which sets the stock up for potentially dramatic moves this week depending on that shifting outlook.",
        "Affirming the 2019 targets would be a letdown for shareholders seeking market-thumping growth this year of close to 20%, but it would still leave the company on pace to easily surpass its goal of $4 billion of annual sales by 2020.",
        "From there, its longer-term outlook targets a far higher revenue base as it expands into new geographies beyond its current focus on Canada and the U.S. Lululemon also sees the potential to greatly expand its presence in areas like outerwear and men's active clothing. Even modest progress toward those goals over the next few years would likely keep it among the market's standout growth stocks .",
        "10 stocks we like better than Lululemon Athletica\r\n When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has quadrupled the market.*",
        "David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Lululemon Athletica wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.",

Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst   Blog:    Top Stock Reports for Procter & Gamble, T-Mobile and     Zoetis   The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features updated research reports on 16 major stocks, including Procter & Gamble, T-Mobile and Zoetis. These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see\u00a0   all of\u00a0   today's\u00a0research reports here     >>>     Procter & Gamble  's shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry in the past year, gaining +45.4% vs. +25.8%. The Zacks analyst thinks that this can be attributed to the company's impressive earnings history. It delivered its 17th straigh t earnings  beat in fourth-quarter fiscal 2019, with sales beat in seven of the last eight quarters. Earnings benefited from its ongoing productivity efforts, while strong organic sales growth backed by higher shipment volumes and favorable price/mix boosted the top line. The company also provided upbeat guidance for fiscal 2020. It is gaining from focus on product improvement, packaging and marketing initiatives, and productivity and cost-savings plan. However, adverse foreign currency rates are hurting the company's top and bottom lines. The company expects currency headwinds to hurt its top line in fiscal 2020. Moreover, global economic challenges and stiff competition poses concern. Shares of T-Mobile  shares have outperformed the Zacks National Wireless industry over the past year, gaining +16.8% vs. +5.1%. The Zacks analyst likes the fact that T-Mobile has cleared most of the regulatory and shareholder approvals for its game-changing merger with Sprint. The New T-Mobile will have about 127 million customers and a strong closing balance sheet, and is expected to bring robust competition in the 5G era. T-Mobile continues to invest in its network and prepare for nationwide 5G with the aggressive rollout of its 600 MHz spectrum. The wireless carrier has introduced 5G millimeter wave network in six cities including New York and Los Angeles. However, a highly competitive and saturated U.S. wireless market remains a major headwind. Intensifying competition is likely to limit its ability to attract and retain customers and may adversely affect operating results. The company launched several low-priced service plans which have enhanced its revenues, but not significantly improved the bottom line.  Zoetis  's shares have outperformed the Zacks Drugs industry in the past year, gaining +40% vs -21.2%. Zoetis' second-quarter earnings and sales beat estimates on the back of growth in new parasiticide products (Simparica and Stronghold Plus) and vaccines, a solid dermatology portfolio, and the addition of Abaxis' diagnostics platform. Livestock product sales returned to growth as well in the second quarter. The Zacks analyst thinks the Abaxis acquisition has strengthened the company's presence in the animal health diagnostics market. Moreover, Zoetis' five-year collaboration agreement with Regeneron will further diversify its portfolio. Shares have outperformed the industry in the year so far. However, growth in the cattle market is expected to be limited in 2019, based on the challenging market conditions for beef and dairy customers. Moreover, growth in the swine market is being impacted by the African swine fever in China.\u00a0 \u00a0 Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Autodesk and FedEx.

      "title": "FB Stock Will Thrive From Focusing on Its True Competition - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips",
        "The narrative surrounding Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) stock appears to stand in stark contrast to its business. Various inquiries by governments have overshadowed the headlines on FB. Though some accusations have affected Facebook stock more than others, it continues to support a relatively cheap valuation. However, it increasingly revealing a Facebook stock driven not by headlines, but more by the nature of its actual competition.",
        "Great fundamentals and government probes seem to define FB stock. From a fundamentals standpoint, it seems investors have every reason to buy Facebook. It owns four of the six most widely-downloaded apps. It also sports a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 19.4. Though profits will fall this year, analysts forecast an average earnings growth rate of almost 22.2% per year over the next five years.",
        "Despite this apparent bargain, most of the news around FB stock seems to revolve around government probes, directly or indirectly. Still reeling from charges that Russia utilized Facebook to influence the 2016 presidential election, the platform has announced tighter rules on political ads in the U.S. this time around.",
        "Also, in July, Facebook agreed to pay a $100 million fine to the SEC over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. However, for a $525 billion company, such penalties amount to pocket change. Furthermore, earlier in the summer, the government targeted every FAANG stock except for Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). Those stocks face antitrust probes from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) over their market dominance.",
        "All of the probes are noise.",
        "I will sometimes tell people that if you get hit over the head enough times, eventually it just stops hurting. I think that has now happened to FB stock. Charges brought by the U.S. or the EU simply do not influence traders like they once did.",
        "Regarding the antitrust probe, people use Facebook's products voluntarily. Since the company derives little if any revenue from the consumer, I do not see this causing lasting harm to FB stock. Also, as I stated in an earlier article , Facebook stock recovered within a week of the announcement on the antitrust probe. Investors treated the charges as a buying opportunity and went on with their lives.",
        "More importantly, the investigations serve as a reminder that Facebook's real competition is Facebook itself. In the social media space, Facebook operates on a higher plain than the likes of Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), Snap (NYSE: SNAP ), and Pinterest (NYSE: PINS ). Consequently, I would argue that Facebook should not consider these companies \"competition\" in the traditional sense.",
        "The real task involves keeping stockholders happy. The company has seen its deepest suffering not from what the FTC thinks, but from losing site of the shareholders. FB achieved the dubious distinction of suffering the largest one-day market cap loss in stock market history after announcing its Q2 2018 results. That $119 billion loss in market cap likely caused more pain than any of the headlines.",
        "Moreover, long investors lost big when the 2012 IPO of FB stock flopped. It was only after Mark Zuckerburg figured out how to derive ad revenue from the mobile site that FB took off.",
        "Government inquiries have not affected FB stock as negatively as those events. As investors lose interest in the probes, attention should return to the fundamentals of FB itself. From there, it should continue moving higher.",
        "Most of Facebook's competition comes from within the company. I do not expect that the battles the company has with both U.S. and EU regulators will end anytime soon. However, I think more investors see these as noise, and each accusation seems to have less effect on FB stock.",
        "Bottom line, interested investors should buy FB stock because it offers long-term profit growth at a relatively low multiple. In time, investor awareness of that fact will only grow. As long as Facebook stays on the same path, owning FB should continue to serve investors well.",

        "The stock market was mixed on Friday morning, setting itself up for a strong week to finish what's been a challenging month of August. Investors seemed reasonably optimistic that central banks globally would have room to keep supporting economic growth, and a lack of new fireworks on the trade front got a good reception. As of 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) was up 51 points to 26,413. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) picked up 2 points to 2,926, but the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) declined 14 points to 7,960.",
        "Among individual companies, AT&T (NYSE: T) got two pieces of favorable news that should bode well for its business going forward. Yet despite a large number of positive earnings reports from retail companies this week, salon specialist Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA) shocked investors with results that failed to live up to high expectations.",
        "Shares of AT&T were up a fraction of a percent as the mobile network giant made progress on two key fronts. One should help the company with its internal operations, while the other extends a valuable agreement with an important partner.",
        "Image source: Getty Images.",
        "Very late Thursday evening, AT&T announced that it had reached tentative agreements with the Communication Workers of America District 3 union group, which covers about 20,000 AT&T workers in nine Southeastern states. The new five-year agreements involve AT&T's wireline network in the Southeast, as well as utility operations for the BellSouth Telecommunications unit and the AT&T Billing Southeast operation. The telecom titan hopes that the union will ratify the agreements in the near future, putting an end to tensions that led to a strike early in the week.",
        "Meanwhile, AT&T also said it had reached an agreement with Lions Gate Entertainment 's\u00a0Starz network on carrying content. The move ensures that DIRECTV, AT&T TV, and U-verse customers will all have access to Starz programming under the multiyear deal.",
        "The wireless telecom industry has been highly competitive for a long time, and AT&T has fought hard to ensure it can remain a leader in the space. Having its employees on its side is a key part of AT&T's future success, and the value of having the right content has never been higher. Investors hope that these moves will help power the dividend giant forward for years to come.",
        "Shares of Ulta Beauty plunged 28% Friday morning after the beauty salon operator reported its second-quarter financial results . The retailer posted revenue growth of 12% on a 6.2% rise in comparable sales, and earnings per share climbed 12% from year-ago levels. Yet investors had wanted far more from the beauty specialist.",
        "CEO Mary Dillon characterized the quarter as having \"solid top-line performance\" and praised Ulta's earnings growth. Yet she also pointed to \"headwinds we are currently seeing in the U.S. cosmetics market\" as being a primary factor in holding Ulta back from even faster growth.",
        "Yet what threw shareholders into turmoil were Ulta's dramatic reductions to guidance for the full year. The company now expects sales to rise just 9% to 12%, with comparable-sales gains of 4% to 6%. Both figures are down markedly from previous projections, and the new earnings guidance for $11.86 to $12.06 per share was down by almost $1 per share from what Ulta anticipated three months ago.",
        "It's been a while since Ulta failed to produce amazing results, and that's a big part of the shock that investors are feeling right now. Ulta still has plenty of potential, but it might take longer than expected to make it through the current rough patch and get itself growing at full speed again.",
        "10 stocks we like better than AT&T\r\n When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has quadrupled the market.*",
        "David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and AT&T wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.",
        "See the 10 stocks",
        "*Stock Advisor returns as of June 1, 2019",
        "Dan Caplinger has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends LGF-A and LGF-B. The Motley Fool recommends Ulta Beauty. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .",

        " For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - August 30, 2019 - Zacks Value Trader is a podcast hosted weekly by Zacks Stock Strategist Tracey Ryniec. Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here:       My Favorite Long-Term Stock Investing Strategy   Welcome to Episode #156 of the Value Investor Podcast. Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio  , shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks. This week, Tracey continues with her series looking at Benjamin Graham's best-selling book for value investors called \" The Intelligent Investor  .\" First published in 1949, the last edition by Graham was published in 1973. But in 2003, Jason Zweig, along with a preface by Warren Buffett, updated the book to account for the events of the last 40 years.  How to Invest for the Long-Term  There are a lot of strategies and techniques for investing for the long-term. But one that doesn't get much love is dollar cost averaging. That's when you devote a certain amount of money on a specified date to buy stocks. Many people with 401ks are already doing this strategy. Benjamin Graham only devotes a few pages in the book to this strategy but it really should get more attention as it's an easy investing method for most people to deploy.  Why Should You Dollar Cost Average?  1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It takes the emotions out of investing. When you are fearful it's easy to panic and sell your stocks. But dollar cost averaging is automatic, no matter how volatile the market may be. 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It prevents the \"waiting for it to bottom\" syndrome. That's when investors wait on the sidelines as a stock drops as they wait to time it perfectly at the bottom. Market timing is hard and few do it well. Many investors never face their fears and end up not ever buying the stock at all. 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It keeps you on track for your plan. Long-term investors should be looking at the long range future whether it's 10 years, 20 years or even 30 years or more.  Dollar Cost Averaging Individual Stocks  While many dollar cost average into mutual funds and ETFs, it can also be successfully deployed with individual stocks. Most investors like to dollar cost average when a stock has declined or when it's trading in a narrow trading range for an extended period of time and seemingly going \"nowhere.\" 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Square SQ   could be a dollar cost averaging candidate. Shares are down 23% over the last year and not going anywhere. It's also trading with its lowest P/E of the last 2 years. 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keycorp KEY   has fallen 24% over the last year as Wall Street has fled the regional banks. As a result, it's cheap, with a forward P/E of just 8.8. It also rewards shareholders for their patience with a dividend yielding 4.7%. 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comerica CMA   , the big Texas and Michigan regional bank, has sunk below its December 2018 lows, as shares are down 39% over the last year. It's now dirt cheap, with a forward P/E of 7.4. This bank is also paying a juicy dividend, yielding 4.6%. 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Delta DAL   is down just 2.9% over the last year as the stock has mostly stayed in a narrow trading range during that time. That makes it the perfect candidate for dollar cost averaging. Investors also get a dividend which is currently yielding 2.9%. 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apple AAPL   shares have fallen 6.7% over the last year. Although they are well off the December 2018 lows, they are still a good candidate for dollar cost averaging. Investors get 1.5% for their patience. What else should investors know about dollar cost averaging? Find out on this week's podcast.  Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a Generation  Be among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it's expected to create 22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity. A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech. Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s.

Recent Broker Rating Upgrades Add Lustre to These 5     Stocks   Investors, while putting their hard-earned money into a stock, obviously expect handsome returns. However, in view of the uncertainties associated with the investment world and the huge number of stocks flooding the market, the task of designing a winning portfolio becomes daunting, particularly in the absence of proper know-how/expertise. In fact, lack of proper guidance often causes one to falter in life. This is true for the investing world as well. Moreover, with time at a premium these days, it is next to impossible for investors to keep track of market movements to identify opportune moment(s) for buying or offloading a particular stock to maximize returns. Therefore, guidance from proper channels is a must.  Time for Some Broker Advice  The experts in the investing world are brokers. Generally, three types of brokers (sell-side, buy-side and independent) are present in the investment world, with sell-side analysts being the most common. They are employed by various brokerage firms to provide unbiased opinion to investors on the stocks under their coverage after thorough research. Buy-side analysts are employed by hedge funds, mutual funds etc. while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors. All types of brokers indulge in thorough research of the stocks under their coverage. They have access to much detailed information on a company. Toward this end, they attend company conference calls/presentations and scrutinize every detail available publicly before advising investors. Naturally, broker advice acts as an invaluable guide for investors in their bid to garner the maximum from their portfolios.  Direction of Earnings Estimates: An Invaluable   Guide  Since brokers meticulously follow the stocks in their coverage, they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company. The estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock. For example, an earnings outperformance by a company generally leads to upward estimate revisions with prices moving north. Similarly, lackluster earnings often lead to stock price depreciation. Investors tend to be guided by the direction of estimate revisions and stock price while formulating their investment strategy.  Making the Most of Broker Guidance  The above write-up clearly suggests that by following broker actions, one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks. Keeping this in mind, we have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions in earnings estimates over the last four weeks. Also, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it has been included. The abovementioned ratio takes care of the company's top line, making the strategy effective.

        "      For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - August 30, 2019 - Zacks Equity Research  Shares of Decker Brands DECK  as the Bull of the Day, Lear Corporation LEA  as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alphabet GOOGL  , Tesla TSLA  and Baidu BIDU .  makeArticleAd();  Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:   Bull of the Day  :   Decker Brands  is proving its not just about UGGs anymore. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is hitting on all cylinders as it recently raised full year guidance. Deckers Brands designs, manufactures and distributes footwear, apparel and accessories. It's most prominent brand is UGG, but it also owns Koolaburra, HOKA ONE ONE, Teva and Sanuk. It's products are sold around the world in department and specialty stores as well as company-owned and operated retail stores. Deckers also operates an online store at deckers.com  .  Another Beat in the Fiscal First Quarter  On July 25, Deckers reported fiscal first quarter 2020 results and again blew by the Zacks Consensus Estimate, this time by 41.7%. Earnings were a loss of $0.67 versus the consensus of a loss of $1.15. It was the tenth earnings beat in a row which is an impressive streak given the struggles of some retailers. In the quarter, sales jumped 10.5% to $276.8 million versus $250.6 million in the year ago period. UGG remains its largest brand as sales rose 1.5% to $138.5 million, up from $136.5 million a year ago. But HOKA ONE ONE continues to be on fire as sales jumped 69.2% to $79.5 million from $47 million a year ago. Teva and Sanuk both saw year-over-year sales declines of 4.3% and 23.5%, respectively. Sanuk sales fell to $18.7 million from $24.4 million. Wholesale sales were also up 10.7% to $196.6 million from $177.6 million a year ago.  Deckers Raised Full Year Guidance  Even though it only gave full year guidance for the first time last quarter, Deckers is already raising it based on the strong first quarter results. The sales forecast was raised to $2.1 billion to $2.125 billion from $2.095 billion to $2.120 billion. Earnings are expected to be in the range of $8.40 to $8.60, up from prior guidance of $8.20 to $8.40. 5 analysts raised their estimates after the report, pushing the Zacks Consensus up to $8.65 from $8.45. That's higher than the company's guidance range but it still means an earnings decline of 2.2% from a year ago as it made $8.84 last year. Fiscal 2021 is looking upbeat as well, with 4 analysts raising and pushing the Zacks Consensus up to $9.47 from $9.28, or an earnings gain of 9.5%.  Bear of the Day  :  Lear Corporation  is facing the global slowdown in the auto industry. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) recently cut its full year guidance. Lear makes seating and electrical and electronic systems for every major automaker in the world. It is headquartered in Michigan and has employees in 39 countries.  A Miss in the Second Quarter  On July 26, Lear reported its second quarter 2019 results and missed on the Zacks Consensus by 4 cents. Earnings were $3.78 versus the Zacks Consensus of $3.82. Sales fell 10% to $5 billion from $5.6 billion in the year ago quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the Xevo acquisition, sales were down 6.7%. In the second quarter, global vehicle production was down more than 7% compared to 2018 with China falling 17% and Europe declining 7%. Lear's results are going to be impacted by the global trends.  Lear Cuts Guidance  Lear didn't mince words in July. It said it was facing a challenging macroeconomic and industry environment which does not look like it will end soon. It cut its full year sales guidance to a range of $19.8 billion to $20.3 billion from its prior forecast of $20.9 billion to $21.7 billion. Analysts also cut their 2019 and 2020 full year earnings estimates. 9 estimates were cut in the last 60 days for 2019 pushing the Zacks Consensus down to $14.98 from $17.45 just 2 months ago. That's an earnings decline of 17.8% as Lear made $18.22 in 2018. 9 estimates were also cut in the last 60 days for 2020 pushing the Zacks Consensus down to $15.88 from $18.97. Analysts see a little bit of growth moving forward as that's earnings growth of 6%.  Shares Sink  It's been tough to be a shareholder over the last year as they have sunk 34.5%. But they now trade with a forward P/E of only 7. And the company is shareholder friendly with a dividend yielding 2.8% as well as a share buyback program which began in early 2011. In the second quarter, the company repurchased $162 million and still has $1.3 billion remaining in the program which goes through Dec 31, 2021. It will reflect 16% of its total market capitalization at current prices.  Additional content:    Is China a Threat to U.S. Autonomous Vehicle     Dominance?   The buzz around autonomous vehicles is continuing to snowball as global tech majors are upping their game to take advantage of the burgeoning prospects. Per an Allied Market Research report  , the global autonomous vehicle market is expected to reach $556.67 billion by 2026 at a CAGR of 39.47% from 2019 to 2026. The long-term prospects are much more alluring. Per a McKinsey research  autonomous vehicles are expected to contribute about 66% of the passenger-kilometers traveled in 2040, generating $1.1 trillion in mobility services revenues and $0.9 trillion in sales that year.  U.S. Leading the Race  The United States is leveraging its first mover advantage in the autonomous vehicle market. Notably, California opened its public roads for testing driverless vehicles way back in 2014. This enabled U.S. developers like Alphabet division Waymo to test millions of miles in the state alone. Major companies like Tesla have taken several initiatives, including partnering with global automakers to strengthen their footprint in the market. In June this year, Apple acquired a self-driving shuttle firm, Drive.ai, to boost its expertise in neural networks, which play an important role in developing software for driverless vehicles. Moreover, Tesla's current fleet of vehicles now represents partial automation, which the company aims to fully convert into self-driving platforms. Per Modor Intelligence, the U.S. autonomous car market  is expected to witness a CAGR of about 46.39% between 2019 and 2024.  China: A Potential Challenger?  Chinese developers like Baidu are catching up fast with their U.S. counterparts. Baidu is the leading tester in China, having covered about 87,000 miles in testing in Beijing last year. However, this is considerably less than a typical month for Waymo. China's policymakers believe that the autonomous vehicles industry is crucial for the country to be successful in its strategy to transform into an AI-led economy by 2030. The government is targeting large-scale adoption of early-stage vehicles in 2020, and expects 10% of all new vehicles sold by 2030 to be fully autonomous. Earlier this month, it was revealed  that China is testing autonomous vehicles in a dedicated highway in east Shandong. \u00a0 Recently, Chinese autonomous-driving company Pony.ai partnered with Toyota to expedite the development and deployment of self-driving vehicles. The pilot cars are likely to start operating on public roads in Beijing and Shanghai in September 2019, leveraging Pony.ai's autonomous driving system in Lexus RX vehicles.  Conclusion  The competition for dominating the autonomous vehicle market is set to heat up between the U.S. and China-based companies in the backdrop of the trade war. However, China needs to optimize autonomous vehicle decision algorithms to suit its complex and chaotic traffic environment. This could delay the adoption of Chinese autonomous cars by two to three years compared to the United States. The first applications of autonomous vehicles in complex traffic might begin in the next five years, but mass adoption is expected to occur only after 2027. Nevertheless, China's efforts in the autonomous vehicles market pose serious threat to the United States' dominance. Notably, in a KPMG index to measure the level of preparedness for autonomous vehicles, China currently holds the 20th position among 25 countries, whereas the United States ranks fourth. Alphabet currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   . While Apple, Baidu and Toyota carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Tesla carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Last August, the first study - TULIP 1 - on anifrolumab failed to meet the primary endpoint of a statistically-significant reduction in disease activity in patients with SLE per the SLE Responder Index 4 (SRI4) measurement at 12 months. AstraZeneca plans to present data from both TULIP 1 and TULIP 2 studies at an upcoming medical conference. SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease with significant unmet need. Anifrolumab is a developmental monoclonal antibody that inhibits the activity of all type I interferons (IFN), which play a central role in lupus. Further, anifrolumab is also being tested in a phase III long-term extension study for SLE and a phase II study for lupus nephritis as part of the TULIP program. Shares of AstraZeneca have rallied 19.5% so far this year against the industry's  decrease of 1.7%.    We would like to remind investors that currently, there are a very few medicines approved for SLE with only one winning the nod in the last 60 years. GlaxoSmithKline's GSK  human monoclonal antibody Benlysta (belimumab) is currently the only medicine specifically developed and approved for SLE. A potential approval for anifrolumab upon review will help AstraZeneca gain access to the lucrative SLE patient population.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider  AstraZeneca currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the large-cap pharma sector include Merck & Co., Inc.

      "title": "OPEC posts first 2019 oil-output rise despite Saudi cuts - Reuters survey - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "By Alex Lawler",
        "LONDON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - OPEC oil output has risen in August for the first month this year as higher supply from Iraq and Nigeria outweighed restraint by top exporter Saudi Arabia and losses caused by U.S. sanctions on Iran, a Reuters survey found.",
        "The 14-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has pumped 29.61 million barrels per day (bpd) this month, the survey showed, up 80,000 bpd from July's revised figure which was the lowest OPEC total since 2014.",
        "OPEC's supply curbs should eventually start to support the price of crude , which has fallen from a 2019 high above $75 a barrel in April to $61 on Friday on concern about slowing oil demand and economic growth, analysts at Commerzbank said.",
        "\"Even the moderate demand growth that can be expected is likely - given the considerable production discipline shown by OPEC - to result in an ongoing tightening of supply and to support rising prices,\" Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg said.",
        "OPEC, Russia and other non-members, known as OPEC+, agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd from Jan. 1 this year. OPEC's share of the cut is 800,000 bpd, to be delivered by 11 members and exempting Iran, Libya and Venezuela.",
        "In August, the 11 OPEC members bound by the agreement, which now runs until March 2020, achieved 136% of pledged cuts, down from 150% in July, the survey found. Two of the three exempt producers pumped less oil.",
        "The biggest supply boost of 80,000 bpd came from Nigeria, Africa's largest exporter, which is seeking a higher OPEC quota and in August continued to produce above its target by the largest margin.",
        "The second-largest rise of 60,000 bpd came from Iraq, which boosted exports from both its northern and southern outlets according to the survey.",
        "Smaller increases came from Libya, where the country's largest oilfield, El Sharara, resumed output on or around Aug. 8 following an outage. Kuwaiti output climbed slightly while remaining below its quota, the survey found.",
        "Saudi Arabia, which in July cut supply even further below its OPEC target in a bid to reduce inventories, has kept output at a similar rate in August. The survey pegged Saudi production at 9.63 million bpd, down from its quota of 10.311 bpd.",
        "Fellow Gulf producer the United Arab Emirates also kept output flat and below its target.",
        "Among countries with lower output, Iran posted the largest decline of 50,000 bpd.",
        "The United States reimposed sanctions on Iran in November after pulling out of a 2015 nuclear accord between Tehran and six world powers. In a bid to cut Iran's sales to zero, Washington in May ended sanctions waivers for importers of Iranian oil.",
        "In Venezuela, supply fell slightly due to the impact of U.S. sanctions on state oil company PDVSA and a long-term decline in production, according to the survey.",
        "July's output was the lowest by OPEC since March 2014, excluding membership changes that have taken place since then, Reuters surveys show.",
        "The Reuters survey aims to track supply to the market and is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Refinitiv Eikon flows data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms."

      "title": "4 Funds to Benefit From Labor Day Weekend Sales - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        " With Labor Day weekend around the corner, American consumers are looking up attractive deals to stock up on their favorite products. Americans could also plan a quick getaway this weekend, thanks to airline deals and hotel discounts. Restaurants and cafes are expected to have greater footfall this holiday weekend as well. Therefore this could be an ideal time to buy mutual funds that invest in stocks well-positioned to benefit from this spending spree.  American Consumers' Going Strong  Thanks to the impressive number of jobs created in July, there has been a remarkable rise in consumer spending. First, consumer spending was rather strong in the quarter ended June 2019 with Americans spending more on dining out, clothes, cars and trucks apart from participating in other similar activities. Consumer confidence was reported at 135.1 in August, higher than analyst expectations of 128. Disposable personal income for June increased 0.4%, indicating the rise in household spending. Finally, wage growth along with an unchanged unemployment rate in July has definitely boosted consumers' spending.  Attractive Retail Deals to Boost Stocks  To bank on consumers' readiness to spend this holiday weekend, retail giants have already come up with a string of offers and discounts. Big houses such as Amazon and Walmart are already offering notable discounts on everything from electronic products to cosmetics and mattresses. Nordstrom, which is a chain of luxury department stores, is also offering discounts on apparel, footwear and fashion accessories etc. Sephora, Lowe's, Best Buy, The Home Depot, Dell and Lenovo are offering great deals amid other companies as well. Therefore one can expect sales to soar this Labor Day weekend along with stock prices of such retailers.  Our Choices  We have, therefore, selected four mutual funds that invest in consumer discretionary, retail and leisure companies.

        "There's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy. Back on August 23, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc 's Director, M. Ann Harlan, invested $29,986.05 into 3,721 shares of CLF, for a cost per share of $8.06. Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money. In trading on Friday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (Symbol: CLF) and achieve a cost basis 1.0% cheaper than Harlan, with shares changing hands as low as $7.98 per share. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc shares are currently trading up about 0.2% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of CLF shares, versus its 200 day moving average:       Looking at the chart above, CLF's low point in its 52 week range is $7.40 per share, with $13.10 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $7.94.

        "TORONTO, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada  and Toronto-Dominion Bank  have agreed to pay a combined C$24.5 million ($18.5 million) to settle charges of foreign exchange trading malpractices brought against the Canadian banks by a regulator, following a settlement hearing held on Friday.",
        "In separate statements of allegations, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) said this week that TD and Royal Bank of Canada  had failed to have sufficient supervision and controls in their foreign exchange trading businesses from at least 2011 to 2013. ",
        "The two banks allowed the inappropriate sharing of confidential customer information by traders at the banks with their counterparts at other firms, the OSC said in the statement of allegations.",
        "TD agreed to pay a combined C$10.1 million, split between fines to the commission and investigation cost, the OSC said. The total bill for RBC, Canada's  biggest bank, came to C$14.4 million.",
        "\"TD takes its obligations to have sufficient controls in its business very seriously. It's integral to its culture of serving customers efficiently. Bottom line is that TD's controls on FX trading is quite different today than it was 6-8 years ago,\" a TD representative told the hearing.",
        "Ahead of Friday's settlement hearing, RBC said the bank was \"pleased to resolve this matter in cooperation with the OSC.",
        "\"The conduct covered by the allegations occurred many years ago, and we have taken a number of steps since that time to enhance our controls,\" RBC said.",
        "Some of the world's biggest investment banks have already paid more than $11 billion in fines to settle U.S., British and European regulatory allegations that traders rigged the currency markets.",

      "text": [
        "The Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies that provide workers' compensation insurance largely to employers operating in hazardous industries such as construction, trucking, logging and lumber, manufacturing and agriculture. These companies also offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products.\r\n Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employees' pay. Claims are generally met by insurance companies or state-run workers' compensation fund.\r\n Let us take a look at the industry's three major themes:",
        "Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak Prospects\r\n The group's Zacks Industry Rank , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. The Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #180, which places it in the bottom 30% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\r\n The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are doubtful of this group's earnings growth potential.\r\n Before we present a few accident and health insurance stocks that investors may focus on, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector, Lags S&P 500\r\n The Accident and Health Insurance industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite but outperformed its own sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 1.1% in the past year while the Finance sector has declined 6.7%. The Zacks S&P 500 composite has decreased 0.7% over the same period.One-Year Price Performance",
        "\r\n Current Valuation\r\n On the basis of trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), which is commonly used for valuing insurance stocks, the industry is currently trading at 1.12X compared with the S&P 500's 3.91X and the sector's 2.69X.\r\n Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.6X, as low as 1.1X and at the median of 1.39X.Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio (TTM)",
        "\r\n Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio (TTM)",
        "\r\n Bottom Line\r\n Continued economic improvement should keep supporting the industry's performance. Also, prudent underwriting and intensive claims management practices with the help of technology position the industry well for growth. Nonetheless, pricing pressure and escalating medical costs remain concerns.\r\n We are presenting one stock with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and three stocks with Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "text": [
        " On this final trading day before the long Labor Day weekend, we expect low volumes overall on what looks to be the strongest trading week since June. Mixed data on income and spending from July fills out the end of the week.  Personal Income  \u00a0from last month came in beneath expectations at 0.1% (expectations were for 0.3%), well beneath the 0.5% reported in the month of June. These figures have been creeping up nicely over the past several months, but we will keep an eye on whether this slowdown is temporary or part of something significant.  Consumer Spending  \u00a0was right in-line with estimates: +0.6% versus 0.6% expected. This doubles the 0.3% reported for June, though again, we'd like to see data from a wider vantage point before concluding new spending trends overall. The consumer has, however, been a major catalyst in economic growth - in just about every metric reported this summer, the consumer has done his or her part in pushing numbers to higher levels. Speaking of higher levels,\u00a0 Core Inflation  \u00a0numbers were also reported this morning, with the headline reaching +0.2%. This represents an in-line read from estimates, also at 0.2%, and consistent with the 0.2% reported in June. Here we see a continuation of inflation metrics upticking very modestly - a condition we've grown accustomed to over the past several months, when many analysts were expecting overall inflation to begin picking up its pace. Next week will be holiday-shortened, but will have no shortage of important economic data, concluding with a monthly jobs report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics a week from today. This will help the Fed make its decision whether to once again lower interest rates in the weeks to follow.   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "text": [
        "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips",
        "Thursday was a good day for the market. But if you want to see something more sustainable than flimsy headline relief, look to the price charts of social media stocks Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) and Snap (NYSE: SNAP ) and put shares of each on the radar for purchase. Let me explain.",
        "Breaking news of China being slightly less aggressive with its tariff retaliation strategy saw the S&P 500 gain 1.28% in the second to last trading day of August. Still, it has been a tough month for index bean counters and to varying degrees, for investors in FB stock, TWTR and SNAP.",
        "A continuing trade war and widening inverted-yield curve have made risk assets a bit riskier with Wall Street. Those concerns have been drivers in the broad-based market barometer underwater for all of August with just one day remaining. The good news for buyers is that's not the entire story for the market or when considering Facebook, Twitter and Snap as stocks to buy.",
        "An arm's length away from today's volatile macro headlines, the broader market signaled a bullish technical-based follow-through day on Aug. 13. Historically, most every significant market rally has begun with this type of bottoming action. It's important to say the least and certainly something to take more seriously than the day-to-day unpredictable headlines.",
        "With the market winds at investors' backs, even though it may not feel like it at times, it's the type of environment where locating stocks to buy makes sense. And with leading social media plays FB stock, TWTR and SNAP also displaying solid technical leadership over this period, the decision is that much more serviceable.",
        "Facebook is the first of our social media stocks to buy. Unlike the broader market, shares failed to score a new all-time-high in July, but don't let that weakness fool you. Over the past month the weekly price chart of FB stock has put together a very constructive and orderly pullback that's challenging channel support and the 38% retracement level.",
        "As Wall Street says goodbye to the month of August and with shares just now generating a bullish oversold crossover from its stochastics indicator, there are some good reasons why FB is one of our social media stocks to buy.",
        "I'd recommend confirming a low is in place and purchase FB stock above last week's engulfing candlestick. From there, the trend should find shares making new relative or even fresh all-time-highs before technical support is challenged again.",
        "Twitter is the first of our social media stocks to buy. Just like people, price charts have been known to change. It's no surprise of course that the two are intertwined. And in the case of TWTR stock, the transformation from a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern into a classically shaped and bullish cup-with-handle base is one that's set to produce sizable returns for investors.",
        "My recommendation in TWTR stock is to buy shares on a breakout of the handle above $43.48. That should set shares up for a quick test of the cup's 2018 high. From there, it may not be to the moon for investors, but a trend back toward Twitter's 2013 all-time-highs near $75 could certainly be in the works.",
        "Snap is the last of our social media stocks to buy. A relative newcomer to the market, this social media stock has been proving naysayers wrong on the price chart throughout 2019 - SNAP stock is up roughly 165% on the year. Now those gloomy Guses are pointing at Instagram's development of a companion messenger app called Threads as the latest threat. Don't believe them for a second.",
        "The price chart continues to reaffirm the narrative SNAP stock investors are on the right side trade and in position to capture more profits from a steady uptrend that has been established. After five weeks of consolidating, SNAP stock could be ready to form its latest higher low within the up-channel.",
        "As of Friday, this stock to buy has formed a weekly doji low. A rally next week through the high of the candlestick would confirm a pivot low and overall offers a decent spot to pick up shares on weakness. Having said that, with SNAP stock's stochastics nearly oversold, but also still pointed down and trend support at much lower prices, I'd be sure to keep a stop-loss tied to the doji rather than hope.",

        "The government will also consider a request for a further 1 billion rand recapitalisation in its budget for the 2020/21 fiscal year, the company said.",
        "Denel, a pillar of the country's once-mighty defence industry, had asked the finance ministry for a 2.8 billion rand bailout to bolster a turnaround plan based on selling non-core assets and agreeing strategic equity partnerships, its Chief Executive Danie du Toit told Reuters in July. But funds weren't initially forthcoming. ",
        "\"There is strong agreement that Denel is a strategic national asset that adds great value to the defence and security sectors,\" the company said in a statement. It cited CEO du Toit as saying the National Treasury had imposed conditions for the bailout that Denel would follow.",
        "Denel, whose finances were hit by mismanagement under previous management, produces military equipment from ammunition and armoured vehicles to missiles and attack helicopters. While it is a supplier to the South African armed forces, the bulk of its business comes from exports.",
        "Saudi Arabia's state defence firm SAMI made a $1 billion bid last year for a broad partnership with Denel, but the approach was rebuffed. ",

      "text": [
        "By Timothy Aeppel",
        "Aug 30 (Reuters) - U.S. shipments of recreational vehicles are expected to drop more sharply this year than previously projected as a slowing economy and a tariff-fueled surge in material costs bite into sales, according to an analysis done for the industry's main trade group.",
        "RV shipments have fallen sharply just before the last three U.S. recessions, so the decline has raised red flags for the economy. ",
        "The analysis was done for the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association by Richard Curtain, director of surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, who independently tracks the industry.",
        "As part of the new forecast, Curtain expects the drop-off in business \"will ease substantially in 2020.\" Curtain projects shipments will decline 3.5% next year to 387,400 units. Until recently, the RV industry was booming. It shipped 504,600 units, a record, in 2017.",
        "The industry's woes illustrate how even the most \"American\" manufacturers can be heavily exposed to tariffs in a world of globalized supply chains. Tariff-related price hikes for everything from vinyl seat covers to metals forced many producers to increase prices to consumers over the past year. That contributed to a slowdown in sales and a rush to cut dealer inventories, according to industry leaders and outside analysts.",
        "Although shipments continue to trend down, the RVIA said,  \"the RV market remains healthy and robust in historical context,\" noting that if the latest projections prove correct, 2019 and 2020 would still rank, respectively, as the fourth and six best years for the industry."

        "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips",
        "You can tell how powerful tech is simply by looking at the trade war the U.S. is in with China. While all sorts of goods are on the tariff lists, most tech, and specially consumer tech, has been left off the table.",
        "And it goes both ways. Most of U.S.-designed and engineered tech is assembled in China. The U.S. doesn't have the manufacturing technology that China has built over the past couple decades. On the other hand, China doesn't have breadth and depth of tech knowledge that most U.S. firms have, nor a system that encourages them to \"move fast and break things\" as Mark Zuckerberg described the startup culture.",
        "Given this reality, and the fact that consumer spending makes up about 70% of the U.S. economy, if the consumer is spending, so are many businesses.",
        "Below are seven of the best tech stocks to buy now, all \"A\"-rated by my Portfolio Grader and still great additions for any growth portfolio.",
        "AppFolio (NASDAQ: APPF ) is a niche-based cloud services provider. It specializes in mid-sized businesses in the property management and legal services sector.",
        "Basically, it handles a lot of documents that need to be stored securely and made available quickly. Traditionally, both of these are paper-intensive businesses, so moving to digital platforms is both a great help and a costly challenge.",
        "APPF saw the opportunity to step in and help and it is now growing as more of these businesses transition into digital records or deepen their commitment to the technology.",
        "APPF stock is up 45% in the past three years and it's up 76% year-to-date. It's a bit expensive relative to its price-to-earnings ratio, but in the long term, this space has plenty of growth left.",
        "Ciena (NYSE: CIEN ) is a key player in the telecommunications networking sector. That means to most consumers it's invisible.",
        "But CIEN has been around since 1992, which means it went through the dotcom boom and survived. Today, it has a $6.4 billion market cap and remains a key player in the optical switching, transport services and software markets as well as other complementary sectors.",
        "This is a big deal right now as all the major U.S. mobile carriers - as well as carriers around the globe - are looking to transition their systems over to 5G. This \"fifth generation\" of telecom promises mobile bandwidth up to a 1,000 times greater than current 4G LTE technology.",
        "Up 24% year-to-date, it is in prime position for massive growth as 5G makes its way into the U.S. market.",
        "Aspen Technologies (NASDAQ: AZPN ) is yet another company that has its roots in ideas and people from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It opened its doors in 1981 and remains a force in the industry today because it's constantly looking for the next problems to solve.",
        "Essentially, AZPN works with enterprise-level organizations to improve their manufacturing and asset management challenges. Its software is used by major companies in the energy, chemical, construction, pharmaceutical, food and beverage and consumer packaged goods sectors.",
        "Its fundamental goal is to make an organization's assets work as efficiently as possible on every level. And nowadays, it has done so with subscription services as well as licensing to maximize its own recurring revenue streams.",
        "Up 63% year-to-date and still trading with a trailing P/E around 35, this is a rock-solid growth stock that can stand the test of time.",
        "Universal Display (NASDAQ: OLED ) is in a great sector and has a great reputation, but it can be a volatile stock.",
        "For example, while OLED stock is up 124% year-to-date and 66% in the past 12 months, the stock was at its current price level in January 2018.",
        "Because it is a leading maker of organic light-emitting diode screens, it is a leading player in this sector across the tech industry.",
        "And now that demand is big - and still growing - it can compete on price with other previously lower-priced screen technologies. OLED screens offer significant advantages but are more expensive, so they have remained in the premium market sectors until recently.",
        "If you can take the volatility, this is a strong long-term play.",
        "Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE: AJRD ) is, if you can't guess by its name, an aerospace company that has roots going back to 1915. It is one of the pioneering companies that began U.S. aerospace efforts for both exploration and defense purposes.",
        "Aerojet Rocketdyne may not carry the cachet of the new space companies like SpaceX or Blue Origin . But it has been doing the work and pushing the boundaries of aerospace engineering long before the CEOs of these new companies were even born.",
        "It remains a niche player in the space, still only sporting a $4 billion market cap. But that means in good times, it's leveraged for growth far quicker than its blue-chip defense competitors. Plus, it gets a lot of their subcontracting work as well.",
        "Up 48% year-to-date yet still trading at a trailing P/E of 25, AJRD stock is well positioned to take advantage of President Donald Trump's new desire to get back into space. Just yesterday he announced the reestablishment of the U.S. Space Command.",
        "Heico (NYSE: HEI ) is another quiet pioneer of the U.S. aerospace community. Although in recent months, its cover has been blown as investors look for solid companies that have what it takes to grow.",
        "HEI has been around since 1957. The company designs and manufactures aerospace, defense and electronic-related products and services. Simply put, it builds the parts that help others build and service jet engines. It also builds the parts that are at the heart of everything that flies -\u00a0 from jets, to rockets, to satellites.",
        "It also services all these components.",
        "As space becomes a new opportunity for commerce, geopolitical advantage and exploration, HEI is at the center of all that. If it flies, HEI is likely to have something to do with keeping it flying.",
        "Up 90% year-to-date it is a rock-solid, long-term growth stock that usually doesn't get the spotlight it's currently under.",
        "PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ) has certainly launched a number of our most visible billionaire visionaries, like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel.",
        "But since its early success, PYPL has found a way to remain relevant and expand. And now thanks to the financial technology wave, its time to shine has come again.",
        "PayPal was of the original \"neobanks\" where people could keep money or transact purchases without using a credit card or direct payments. Now it is the proud owner of Venmo, the most popular peer-to-peer money service out there.",
        "Fintech is one of the hottest sectors in the market right now. The digitalization of banking is going to be as disruptive to banking as e-commerce has been to the retail industry.",
        "PYPL has proven that it is ready for the challenge. And with a $129 billion market cap, it may not be as shiny as its smaller competitors, but it is still a powerful force.",

      "text": [
        "  Big Lots, Inc. BIG  second-quarter fiscal 2019 marked the third straight quarter of positive earnings surprise. The bottom line also surpassed the management's guided range, courtesy of better expense management. On the top-line front, the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second straight quarter. Better-than-expected results prompted management to issue an encouraging outlook for third-quarter fiscal 2019. As a result, shares the company increased 20% in the  pre-market trading  session. However, the stock has declined 23.9% year to date against the industry  's 34.1% growth. We believe the company's encouraging outlook for the third quarter and its meaningful progress on the front of Store of the Future initiative along with increased focus on Rewards loyalty program and e-commerce business will provide much-needed cushion to the stock.  Let's Delve Deeper  This Columbus, OH-based company posted adjusted earnings of 53 cents a share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents. The bottom line also exceeded its earlier guidance of 35-45 cents. However, the metric came below 59 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. Net sales grew 2.5% to $1,252.4 million and marginally came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,251 million. The top line increased on account of solid comparable store sales and sales growth in high volume new stores, partly offset by reduced store count year over year. Comparable store sales improved 1.2% and came in line with the company's prior guidance of low-single-digit increase. This marked the fifth successive quarter of comparable store sales growth. Gross profit increased 1.4% year over year to $498.2 million, while gross margin contracted 40 basis points to 39.8%. In the reported quarter, adjusted SG&A expenses came in at $455 million, up 6.7% year over year, while the same (as a percentage of net sales) rose 140 basis points to 36.3%. Adjusted operating income came in at $32.6 million, down 63.8% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, operating margin contracted 100 basis points to 2.6% in the quarter under review.

Total shareholders' equity was $644.5 million. Management stated that increases in inventory was due to \"moving forward inventory commitments to support earlier resets of new assortments in the key categories of Furniture and Soft Home, and the slower than anticipated sell through of seasonally sensitive product in Q2 largely due to weather. This growth was partially offset by a lower store count year-over-year.\" Long-term obligations under the bank credit facility totaled $467.8 million, up from $324.7 million in the prior-year period. Year to date, the company has returned about $75 million to its shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividend. Management anticipates cash flow of approximately $75 million for fiscal 2019, up from the earlier estimate of $65 million.

The group exclusively shared a trailer for the piece   with   Variety    . \"These Sleepless Nights\" lets viewers explore a 4-part   mini-documentary with Magic Leap AR headsets by walking around a   large cube. Each sides of the cubes helps them unlock part of the   story, shining a light on the plight of people who have gone   through the process of an eviction.   makeArticleAd(); \"These Sleepless Nights\" executive director Edward Saatchi   told   Variety    that the documentary had been inspired by Matthew Desmond's book   \"Evicted.\" The goal of the doc was to both raise awareness about   the issue of evictions, as well as raise money for groups that   work on housing for the homeless in cities like Oakland and New   York, he said. \"It's starting a conversation on the right to   shelter.\" The 22-minute mixed reality documentary has been created and   directed by   Gabo   Arora    , whose previous VR films include \"Clouds Over Sidra\" and \"Zikr:   A Sufi Revival.\" Arora told   Variety    that it was a challenge to reinvent immersive filmmaking for AR,   in part because of the limits of today's AR hardware. \"VR takes   you to a different world,\" he said. \"With AR, you have to think   about choreography a lot more.\" The solution for \"These Sleepless Nights\" was to rely a lot   more on spatial audio, and less on video that aims to take over   your field of view. \"A lot of it is based on audio,\" Arora said.

      "title": "Abercrombie (ANF) Q2 Loss Narrows, Stock Down on Tariff Woes - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "  Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ANF  incurred narrower-than-expected loss in second-quarter fiscal 2019. However, i t report  ed earnings in the prior-year quarter. Moreover, the company's top-line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year. Further, management lowered sales view for fiscal 2019.  makeArticleAd();  The company assumes the impact of List 3 and List 4 tariffs should hurt near-term results. These tariffs are likely to have an adverse impact of about $6 million on the company's cost of goods sold and gross profit in the current fiscal year.    In fiscal 2019, the company expects gross margin to decline 50-90 basis points (bps) from 60.2% recorded in fiscal 2018. The downside can be attributed to combined unfavorable impact of currency and expected tariffs of about 60 bps. For the fiscal third quarter, gross margin is likely decline nearly 100 bps from 61.3% reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Currency headwinds and anticipated tariffs to the tune of 90 bps primarily resulted in the downturn.    Abercrombie expects merchandise imports from China in the current fiscal year to be less than 20%, down from 25% last fiscal. Consequently, shares of the company slumped nearly 15% yesterday. In the past three months, the stock has lost 17.4% against the industry  's 4.8% growth.      Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company remains focused on achieving its long-term targets through the execution of the transformation efforts. In the United States, Abercrombie witnessed a robust start to back-to-school and expects the momentum to continue in the second half of fiscal 2019 backed by strength in products and solid marketing efforts.    In a separate press release, Abercrombie declared two major appointments to direct its Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC) operations. Daniel Le Vesconte and Olga Wu are appointed as the Group Vice Presidents for the EMEA and APAC regions, respectively. These officials are likely to carry out the company's strategies and boost brands to aid growth in the corresponding local markets.   Q2 Earnings & Sales    Abercrombie incurred loss of 48 cents per share in the second quarter, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 52 cents. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of 6 cents. Bottom-line results were hurt by the negative impact of flagship store exit expenses to the tune of 50 cents.   Abercrombie & Fitch Company Price, Consensus and     EPS Surprise        Abercrombie & Fitch Company   price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart    |   Abercrombie & Fitch Company Quote   Net sales totaled $841.1 million, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $854 million and dipped 0.2% from the year-ago quarter's sales of $842.4 million. On a constant-currency basis, the top line rose 1%.    Brand-wise, net sales improved 1% to $504.8 million at Hollister, while it dipped 2% to $336.3 million at the Abercrombie brand. From a geographical viewpoint, net sales grew 2% in the United States while dropped 4% in international markets.    Notably, digital business continued to perform well backed by robust momentum across both brands and geographies. Also, digital channel sales improved in the double-digit range during the quarter under review.   Comps in Detail    Comparable sales (comps) remained flat against 3% growth in the year-ago quarter. This was backed by favorable cross-channel traffic, compensated with lower conversion. Brand-wise, comps remained flat for both Hollister and Abercrombie brands.    Moreover, comps benefited from strong performance in the United States, wherein the metric improved 2%. This was partly offset by a 3% comps decline in international markets.   Margins    Gross margin contracted 90 basis points (bps) to 59.3% on account of higher average unit costs (AUC) due to product mix and a marginal fall in average unit retail (AUR). Further, the metric was hurt by increased promotions and markdowns, given the highly promotional U.S. retail environment.    Abercrombie incurred operating loss of $39.5 million compared to adjusted operating loss of $9 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating loss margin contracted 580 bps and fell 530 bps on a currency-neutral basis. Operating performance in the quarter was hurt by adjusted operating expenses to the tune of 470 bps owing to an unfavorable impact of 530 bps from the exit charges of flagship outlet.   Other Financials    Abercrombie ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $499.8 million and gross borrowings under its term-loan agreement of $253.3 million. As of Aug 3, 2019, inventories amounted to $487.1 million, reflecting 7% growth from the prior-year period. In the first six months of fiscal 2019, the company spent $94.2 million as capital expenditures.    Moreover, Abercrombie ended the fiscal second quarter with inventory up nearly 7% and expects the metric to grow low to mid single-digits at the end of the fiscal third quarter.    The company also bought back about 3.5 shares in second-quarter fiscal 2019. At the end of the fiscal second quarter, Abercrombie had nearly 5 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. So far in fiscal 2019, it returned $84.2 million via share repurchases and dividends.    On Aug 22, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share on the Class A shares. This is payable on Sep 16, 2019, to its shareholders of record as of Sep 6.   Store Update    Abercrombie has been closely working on its goals of optimizing store fleet, which resulted in significant store closures over the past eight years. The company takes these closures as an opportunity to improve store productivity by reducing store occupancy costs. Notably, the global store optimization is a key component of its efforts to deliver operating margin expansion and reach its goals for fiscal 2020.    As part of its continued focus on optimizing store fleet, Abercrombie announced plans to close three additional flagships. Apparently, it shut down Hollister SoHo in the reported quarter. The other two are Milan A&F that is expected to be closed by the end of fiscal 2019, and Fukuoka A&F in fiscal 2020.    Simultaneously, the company delivered 26 new store experiences in the reported quarter. It is currently on track to deliver about 85 new experiences in fiscal 2019.   Outlook    For fiscal 2019, Abercrombie now estimates sales to be flat to up 2% backed by comps growth and contributions from new stores. This will be somewhat offset by adverse impacts of currency to the tune of roughly $45 million, of which $26 million is reflected in the first-half results. Earlier, sales growth was projected in the band of 2-4%.    Further, comps are expected in the range of flat to positive 2% versus the earlier projection of growth in low-single-digits and 3% improvement in the year-ago period.    Operating expenses, excluding other operating income, are now expected to increase nearly 2-3% from adjusted operating expenses of $2.03 billion in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior view of 4-5% increase. The increase mainly reflects flagship store exit charges of about $45 million incurred in the reported quarter. Furthermore, it anticipates effective tax rate to be in mid-20s.    Additionally, Abercrombie continues to envision capital expenditure of roughly $200 million for fiscal 2019.    For the fiscal third quarter, the company anticipates sales to be up about 1% from the prior-year quarter. This includes an adverse impact of nearly $10 million from negative currency translations. Meanwhile, comps are anticipated to remain flat.    Operating expenses (excluding other operating income) are estimated to increase 1-2% from adjusted operating expenses of $493 million in third-quarter fiscal 2018. Excluding one-time charges in the prior-year quarter, adjusted operating expenses are likely to be flat to up 1%. Effective tax rate is anticipated in mid-to-upper 20s.   3 Key Picks in the Retail Space    Boot Barn Holdings, Inc.

        " Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ANF  incurred narrower-than-expected loss in second-quarter fiscal 2019. However, i t report  ed earnings in the prior-year quarter. Moreover, the company's top-line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year. Further, management lowered sales view for fiscal 2019.  makeArticleAd();  The company assumes the impact of List 3 and List 4 tariffs should hurt near-term results. These tariffs are likely to have an adverse impact of about $6 million on the company's cost of goods sold and gross profit in the current fiscal year.    In fiscal 2019, the company expects gross margin to decline 50-90 basis points (bps) from 60.2% recorded in fiscal 2018. The downside can be attributed to combined unfavorable impact of currency and expected tariffs of about 60 bps. For the fiscal third quarter, gross margin is likely decline nearly 100 bps from 61.3% reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Currency headwinds and anticipated tariffs to the tune of 90 bps primarily resulted in the downturn.    Abercrombie expects merchandise imports from China in the current fiscal year to be less than 20%, down from 25% last fiscal. Consequently, shares of the company slumped nearly 15% yesterday.

        "     Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company remains focused on achieving its long-term targets through the execution of the transformation efforts. In the United States, Abercrombie witnessed a robust start to back-to-school and expects the momentum to continue in the second half of fiscal 2019 backed by strength in products and solid marketing efforts.    In a separate press release, Abercrombie declared two major appointments to direct its Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC) operations. Daniel Le Vesconte and Olga Wu are appointed as the Group Vice Presidents for the EMEA and APAC regions, respectively. These officials are likely to carry out the company's strategies and boost brands to aid growth in the corresponding local markets.   Q2 Earnings & Sales    Abercrombie incurred loss of 48 cents per share in the second quarter, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 52 cents. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of 6 cents. Bottom-line results were hurt by the negative impact of flagship store exit expenses to the tune of 50 cents.",

        "Any type of unpaid debt can hurt your credit score, and medical debt is no exception. But there are protections in place to limit that damage.",
        "Image source: Getty Images",
        "The better your credit score , the easier it'll be for you to borrow money as needed, whether it's in the form of a mortgage, an auto loan, or a personal loan . But when you fail to pay your bills, your score can easily get dragged down substantially. And unfortunately, it doesn't matter whether those bills are frivolous or unavoidable in nature -- an unpaid bill is an unpaid bill, which means that if you manage to rack up medical debt, your credit score could take a massive hit.",
        "Medical debt is such a problem that it's actually the number one source of personal bankruptcy filings in the country. And it's not just folks without insurance who land in health-related debt; even those who are insured often struggle to keep up with their out-of-pocket costs, especially when high deductibles and copays come into play. But even though medical debt can bring down your credit score, recent debt-reporting changes offer some degree of protection in this regard.",
        "Generally speaking, once you're at least 30 days late on a debt payment, it'll be reported to the three major credit bureaus -- Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. And at that point, your score is automatically at risk.",
        "Medical debt , however, has worked differently since late 2017, when a new set of laws was implemented to help protect consumers. The aforementioned credit bureaus now have to wait a full 180 days before adding unpaid medical bills to your record. That gives you more time to either pay off that debt, or navigate the appeals process with your insurer in the event that you feel you shouldn't be financially responsible for the bills in question. That six-month window also gives you time to sort out disputes with medical providers -- say, if you were billed incorrectly for the services you received.",
        "Another change that went into effect in 2017 is that delinquent medical bills that are later paid by an insurer must be removed from your credi t report so that they don't continue to hurt your credit score. Normally, a delinquency can take up to seven years to be removed from your credit record.",
        "If you've racked up a series of medical bills you can't pay, you now have a 180-day window to resolve the matter before it hurts your credit score -- but you'll need to take action during that period. First, if you feel the services in question should've been paid by your insurer, file an appeal. The sooner you get that process started, the better, since it can be a lengthy one.",
        "If you know you're the one responsible for paying those bills, but you don't have the money, reach out to your provider and ask about working out a payment plan. As long as you keep up with that plan, the unpaid portion of your total bill won't be considered late or delinquent, and therefore won't be reported as such.",
        "You can also try to negotiate with your provider and asked for a reduced rate for the care you received. Medical offices will often grant you some degree of leeway if you can prove that you're paying out of pocket without an insurer to help cover your costs.",
        "Finally, if you do win an appeal with your insurance company, and your outstanding medical bills are paid off, check your credit report once that happens to make sure that change is reflected. If not, you may need to reach out to each of the three aforementioned bureaus with proof that your medical debt no longer exists so that it can be removed from your record immediately.",
        "Medical debt is often unavoidable, but that doesn't mean it can't hurt your credit score. The good news? You get more time to resolve medical debt than you do for other types of debt, so take advantage of that 180-day window to avoid financial trouble down the line.",

Presumably the only reason for a company insider to choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

        "A particularly strong insider buying signal is what we call a \"cluster-buy\" where three or more different insiders make open market purchases within a short period of one another. At East West Bancorp, Inc (Symbol: EWBC), 6 different insiders purchased 43,140 shares at an average price of $38.85/share, for a total of $1.68M, with the most recent purchase on August 29, 2019.      Presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money. So when multiple insiders all decide to make purchases around the same time, it could be a strong indication that the stock is undervalued.

      "title": "8 Precious Metals Stocks to Mine For - Nasdaq.com",
      "text": [
        "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips",
        "Precious metals stocks have been on fire over the last few months, and you don't have to dig deep to know why. Essentially, investments like gold and silver represent safe-haven assets during times of uncertainty or turmoil. With the raging U.S.-China trade war, along with multiple geopolitical flashpoints, there's plenty of both descriptors to go around.",
        "Primarily, one of the biggest catalysts for precious metals stocks to buy is the inversion of the yield curve . Specifically, the yield for the longer-maturing 10-year Treasuries dipped below the yield of the shorter-maturing 2-year Treasuries. Therefore, what we have is a nonsensical economic condition: a riskier (based on time exposure) asset offers less reward than a more stable or predictable one.",
        "That kind of circumstance invites investor fears, which is bullish for precious metals stocks to buy. However, what could really send this commodities sub-segment to the moon is the Federal Reserve's response.",
        "Naturally, the central bankers don't want this circumstance to continue; otherwise, no one in their right minds would buy 10-year Treasuries. First on the Fed's agenda is to flatten the yield curve. And at this point, that can only be accomplished by cutting benchmark interest rates further. Theoretically, this should drive down the 2-year Treasures' yield below the 10-year bonds.",
        "But will this work? I'm not a central banker so I'm not an expert on this topic. But what I do know is that such actions are inflationary. And based on the present fiscal and economic circumstances, this is the only lever the Fed can pull.",
        "In layman's terms, gold and similar commodities will moon. Thus, here are eight precious metal stocks to consider.",
        "Precious metal stocks such as Barrick Gold (NYSE: GOLD ) have certain risks that the underlying physical bullion markets do not; namely, the human element. Therefore, it pays when loading up on commodities-based stocks to buy to consider a heavier allocation toward established, stable names. With a long history and a market capitalization nearing $34 billion, GOLD stock certainly qualifies.",
        "Aside from its sheer size, what I like about Barrick is its quality of international exposure. Although geopolitical risks in their African projects exist, for the most part, the mining company is exposed to stable administrations. We're talking names like Canada, Chile, Australia, and the U.S.",
        "Plus, GOLD stock is bringing home the goods for stakeholders. On a year-to-date basis, shares have jumped over 46%. And since the beginning of June, they're up 51%.",
        "Ordinarily, I'd avoid such technically hot assets. However, GOLD stock is likely riding on unprecedented series of fundamental tailwinds.",
        "Many investors understandably avoid precious metals stocks because of the reputation of speculative mining projects. But like any sector, it's the quality of the individual company that matters. And with Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE: NEM ), you have the provenance of nearly a century of experience. Thus, even if we see the return of a bear market in the metals, NEM stock will probably stick around.",
        "But I'm almost certain that such pessimism is far out into the future. For the near-to-intermediate term, Newmont Goldcorp should attract significant investor dollars. On a YTD basis, NEM stock has gained over 16%. That may not sound like much until you consider that since the beginning of May, shares have jumped nearly 35%.",
        "Moving forward, I see strong gains ahead despite the already impressive performance. The majority of Newmont Goldcorp's projects are located in the stable regions of North America and Australia. Four projects are in South America, while only two are levered to Africa. Therefore, even if geopolitics rears its ugly head, NEM stock should find significant insulation.",
        " Another top name to add to your list of precious metals stocks to buy is Agnico Eagles Mines (NYSE: AEM ). While some of the top-tier miners have some exposure to geopolitical risks, AEM stock is arguably almost completely insulated. I say this because Agnico Eagles has mining projects only in Canada, Finland, and Mexico. None of these countries strike me as dangerously unstable.",
        "But what really stands out about AEM stock is that the underlying company does not engage in forward gold sales. Forward sales are commonly used in sectors like commodities to help businesses predictably flatten the target assets' volatility. However, with Agnico Eagle, the eschewing of forward gold sales is a long-standing policy. Thus, buying AEM stock gives you full exposure to the gold spot price.",
        "In prior years, that was a raw deal. But at this juncture, this is exactly what you want. Already, the gold price has shot up over $1,550. Just a couple months ago, it was under $1,300. And with nothing indicating a headwind to this run, AEM stock gives you cheap exposure to the yellow metal.",
        " Although it's an incredibly hot name right now, Royal Gold (NASDAQ: RGLD ) is an interesting play. And in my opinion, RGLD stock still has significant upside remaining.",
        "Most precious metals stocks to buy in the mining sector are risky because of the unknown. This is especially true for companies specializing in gold exploration: sometimes you hit pay dirt, and sometimes you don't. Because of the unpredictability involved, these investments can be incredibly volatile. But with RGLD stock, the underlying company mitigates the wildness through its streaming business model.",
        "Instead of actively mining for metals, Royal Gold instead has streaming and royalty agreements with miners. Typically, a company like Royal Gold will pay an upfront fee in exchange for future deliveries of a particular asset.",
        "Because of this inherent risk mitigation, RGLD stock has outperformed many other physical mining-centric organizations. For instance, on a YTD basis, RGLD shares have skyrocketed nearly 61%. With bullion markets likely headed higher, Royal Gold might still be a bargain.",
        " If you're looking to precious metals stocks for protection in the markets, it's natural to only focus on gold. However, as my sit-down with commodities expert David Morgan illustrates, silver has tremendous potential right now. As proof, since my interview with the godfather of silver investing, the target metal has shot up over 18%.",
        "Of course, the silver spot price is more volatile than gold. But if you want exposure to this exciting metal but with some risk mitigation, consider Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE: WPM ). Formerly known as Silver Wheaton, WPM stock is no longer just a pure-play silver equity. However, the company still enjoys one of the biggest silver streaming businesses in the world.",
        "As I mentioned above for Royal Gold, WPM stock is intriguing for this streaming model. Unlike every other mining outfit, Wheaton doesn't have the associated onerous overhead costs. Management knows what their outlays are because they are negotiated ahead of time. That's a huge plus for WPM stock because pure miners operate under a cloud of uncertainty.",
        "In my view, silver is the cryptocurrency of precious metals stocks to buy. Although it has the same monetary fundamentals as gold - silver was at one point \"real money\" - it also seems to have a mind of its own. Nevertheless, for me, the outsized potential for silver is enough to accept the risks. If you have a similar mindset, you should take a look at First Majestic Silver (NYSE: AG ) and AG stock.",
        "For starters, First Majestic Silver lives up to the hype of precious metals stocks levered to the white metal. Since January's opening price, AG stock has soared over 91%. And since the beginning of August, First Majestic shares have popped up over 14%.",
        "As I've mentioned with the other sector players, I don't like to engage such strong momentum. But I keep going back to the Federal Reserve's inability to do anything but cut interest rates. That's inflationary for gold and should be exponentially so for silver.",
        "Finally, on a fundamental note, First Majestic primarily focuses on Mexico's mining market. Close to home and a vital U.S. trading partner, I don't foresee major problems there. Therefore, AG stock also provides some measure of geopolitical insulation.",
        "Sibanye Gold (NYSE: SBGL ) has significant operations in South Africa, which is both a blessing and a curse. Obviously, South Africa is exceptionally endowed with natural resources, including multiple robust gold mines. That naturally bodes well for SBGL stock. But on the flipside, the country's class and race dynamics have caused substantial conflicts, including mining-related labor strikes .",
        "Recently, such strikes over job losses and pay cuts have negatively impacted Sibanye Gold. As a result, SBGL stock hasn't seen the explosive returns that other precious metals stocks have witnessed over the past few weeks. Nevertheless, Sibanye has serious potential, as judged by its explosive YTD return of over 110%.",
        "Now, you might say that among this sector's stocks to buy, superior options exist. However, very few companies have the kind of robust exposure to the other precious metals, platinum and palladium. In particular, palladium is an incredibly rare commodity and Sibanye is the world's second-largest producer of it. Thus, I like my chances with SBGL stock.",
        "I'm going to be completely blunt: Norilsk Nickel PJSC (OTCMKTS: NILSY ) is a ridiculously speculative name among precious metals stocks. Therefore, I wouldn't buy NILSY stock unless you fully understand that you're taking a gamble. Even then, I wouldn't allocate all of my \"stupid\" money on Norilsk.",
        "With these caveats out of the way, I'm still very intrigued with the potential upside opportunity in NILSY stock. Russia has the largest stockpile of palladium in the world. As such, Norilsk Nickel is the world's top producer of this rare commodity.",
        "Why am I so big on palladium? First, it's incredibly rare. Up until recently, one troy ounce of palladium was worth more than the equivalent size of gold. And while the yellow metal is on a run due to global economic fears, palladium still has a chance to regain its crown.",
        "That brings me to my second point: palladium has multiple uses and should be a relevant commodity in the 21 st century. The metal is both resilient to atmospheric influences and is extremely ductile . These properties lend themselves to high-tech usage, which is why I'm even considering NILSY stock.",
        "As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long the physical precious metals mentioned in this story.",

        "Russia has for years tried to encourage people to save for their pensions alongside state pensions, but the public has been wary of investing in the funds, as rules have often changed and as several non-state funds have been bought and sold.",

They have filed their prospectus. I confessed that I've learned a lot about this company this morning because I do not have a $2,000 exercise bike at my home.",

        "Let's begin with Altria and Philip Morris, two tobacco companies in advance talks to merge. If this sounds vaguely familiar, it's because it would reunite them after they split apart in 2008. Jim Mueller, what do you think of it all?",
        "Mueller: I think it's a very interesting story. It has a lot of play in what's happening today with e-cigarettes and vaping and all that. In 2003, Philip Morris, renamed itself Altria, trying to get away from the poor branding that Philip Morris itself had. That didn't work, but, OK. Altria then, in 2008, spun off Philip Morris International and basically separated itself into two companies, U.S. only -- Altria -- and Philip Morris International, which was everywhere else. They sold the same stuff. They sold the same brands, Marlboro being the big one. But the U.S. was separate from the international. That was because of expected increased regulation and litigation in the States. There were still a lot of lawsuits going on. Philip Morris felt it could do better. This was right when the global financial crisis was happening, 2008.",
        "What actually happened is, regulation moderated over the following decade up into the 2015 and 2016 time frame, and the U.S. dollar remained strong, both of which hurt the separation, especially since Philip Morris International was paying dividends in U.S. dollars. Today, smoking is down around the world, especially in the U.S. Shipments are down about 10% over the past decade for Philip Morris, about 35% down for Altria. But Altria is much more profitable than Philip Morris, earning $7 billion of net income on $20 billion in revenue last year vs. $8 billion in net income for Philip Morris on $30 billion. Altria is more profitable. That's because Altria has been able to raise prices steadily and better in the U.S.",
        "Greer: Emily, what do you think?",
        "Flippen: Well, for maybe younger listeners, younger investors out there, personally, I haven't looked at tobacco companies but I know the name Altria because Altria has some really proactive, you could say, investments into cannabis company Cronos Group and JUUL, e-vaping. I recognize the names from their investments. It'll be interesting to see what happens to Altria's investments if this merger does go through. PMI has been pretty open about the fact that they aren't interested in getting into either of those spaces. So it'll be interesting to see what happens with JUUL and Cronos.",
        "Mueller: JUUL has been expanding sales internationally, cannibalizing Philip Morris' thing. The merger would help JUUL in getting international distribution, especially with JUUL being in trouble with regulators --",
        "Flippen: That's an understatement.",
        "Mueller: -- following all these issues with lung diseases that are cropping up, and a recent death in Illinois from a vaping-related lung disease.",
        "Greer: We talked about this a bit on Monday's MarketFoolery . When we think about vaping, is that going to essentially follow the same trajectory as traditional tobacco products and smoking? Where it gets regulated to a point, and then it seems to take hold in the U.S., so the growth is all overseas? Is that where vaping is headed? Is vaping basically where smoking was in the '90s?",
        "Flippen: I'm not sure if I agree with that entirely. Vaping at this point hasn't been proven to cause something like lung cancer. That's not to say it's healthy. Like Jim mentioned, there's already been one vaping-related illness associated in Illinois. The fact is, we don't know the long-term effects of it. I will say that Altria already has investments into other industries as well. You look at nicotine being the addictive substance in things like e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes. They have investments in companies that are looking to create edible nicotine, nicotine that you can ingest without having to smoke or vape. There's still an opportunity for them to expand. I just think it's going to require a lot of research.",
        "Mueller: And then there's one more thread to this story in that Philip Morris has been spending billions of dollars developing smokeless, heated-up tobacco in something called IQOS, which is like a cigarette. It has a cigarette-like piece injected into this heater that you then draw in the vaporized products from the heated-up tobacco. They're hoping to make that grow sales. The FDA, recently -- last April, I believe -- approved sales of it. Philip Morris wants to market it as a safer alternative. The FDA has not yet said yes on that.",
        "Greer: Speaking of hoping to grow sales, KFC is busting out Beyond fried chicken. Yes, they are getting into the Beyond Meat game. Now, they are testing the new recipe in their Atlanta store. It's a plant-based protein instead of chicken. KFC, part of Yum! Brands (NYSE: YUM) , which, we should remind everyone, also owns Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, among others. Emily, so far so good. In Atlanta, Beyond fried chicken sold out in less than five hours. What do you think?",
        "Flippen: KFC was smart to test this in Georgia. Southerners love their fried chicken. It sold out in five hours in Georgia. Hopefully this means there's going to be a national rollout. That potential for KFC to expand their Beyond fried chicken to all of their locations is still there. We saw a similar thing happen with Burger King and the Impossible Whopper. As a newly minted vegetarian, I am personally interested, extremely interested in trying this Beyond Chicken. Fried chicken, I think, is one of those foods that it's hard for people who are trying to be conscious about their meat consumption to give up.",
        "But I will say, what I thought was particularly interesting about this story in particular is that they actually cook the Beyond Meat chicken in the same fryers that they cook regular chicken in, which means for strict vegans and vegetarians, they're actually not going to be able to eat this product. And I think it's actually a calculated move on their part. They're going to say that they don't see their target market as vegans and vegetarians. They see their target market as people who are trying to be more flexitarian; if they can avoid choosing a meat product, they will choose to avoid it.",
        "Greer: Flexitarian, did you make that up? Or is that a thing?",
        "Flippen: Oh, no, it's a thing.",
        "Greer: Oh, I love that! I'm a flexitarian, I've decided. I eat what I want, when I want.",
        "Flippen: Well, flexitarians are meat-conscious consumers.",
        "Greer: Oh. No, I'm not a flexitarian. [laughs] Jim, what do you think?",
        "Mueller: I'd like to see it. It's supposed to taste like chicken, right? Just like the Impossible Burger is supposed to taste like beef. But, does it have the same mouthfeel?",
        "Flippen: No, probably not.",
        "Mueller: When you cut it, does it have the same fibers that chicken has?",
        "Flippen: I don't think that matters, if I'm honest with you. I think it needs to taste good. I think it needs to taste close enough to meat that people will feel good about making that choice while still not sacrificing all the taste. But as it stands right now, I don't think there's any meat substitute on the market that will give you the entire experience of eating meat. We're getting there. I just don't think we're there yet.",
        "Greer: So, does this make you more excited about Yum! Brands as an investment?",
        "Flippen: I was already excited about Yum! Brands. You don't need to get me excited about Taco Bell. I'm already there. Yum China has actually been on fire recently. I'm not an active investor myself, but I was already excited about the company to begin with.",
        "Mueller: I was going to make one more point about these meat substitutes. The farms raising the cattle are going to be replaced with farms raising, what is it, soy protein? Soy beans as the base of these now?",
        "Greer: Yep.",
        "Mueller: Plus, all the additives they have to add to make it taste like beef and heme protein to make it taste like beef. Are they adding something to chicken to make it taste like chicken? Everything's supposed to taste like chicken, right? [laughs] It gets away from animals, sure, but it's not necessarily as good for the environment overall.",
        "Flippen: Actually, it's better for the environment.",
        "Mueller: Is it?",
        "Flippen: Significantly. Cattle continues to be one of those things that contributes a lot to environmental degradation, especially in the United States. Environmentally, I think the argument is sound for meat alternatives. I think where you get into an argument is the health argument. There's a lot of people saying these additives are not necessarily better for you to consume vs. meat. But I actually think that the target market, like I said, aren't people looking for a healthy alternative. I think they're people looking to reduce their meat consumption.",
        "Greer: Well, as an aspiring flexitarian, I may give it a shot.",
        "Flippen: [laughs] Great!",
        "Greer: For our final story, we are going to talk Peloton, the home fitness exercise bike lifestyle brand company that you won't find anywhere in my house. They filed for an IPO on Tuesday. Now, as I mentioned earlier, $2,000 indoor bikes. That's one of the things they sell. They're internet-connected, and then you pay a subscription to join a class. Emily, are you buying?",
        "Flippen: You sound way too negative about the premise of the company there, Mac. It's an interesting company. The thing I found most interesting about their filing was how much they're posting in revenue. Nearly $1 billion in revenue over the past 12 months on a half million different subscribers. They're getting this really high, for the bike, up-front fee, $2,500, plus recurring revenue from their subscriptions. As a business, it actually isn't as bad as some may think. Unfortunately, home exercise equipment does get a bad rap. But Jim, as we\u00a0were talking earlier, mentioned there's not much of a moat here with this business.",
        "Greer: I just think NordicTrack. That's the problem. And you are right. There was some negativity. I apologize for that. But it just feels like this is going to end up being a paperweight.",
        "Mueller: I think their revenue growth is very impressive. One hundred and ten percent revenue growth last year to $915 million. Unfortunately, they're growing their losses at 300%. They went from a loss of $48 million to a loss of $196 million over the same time period. That really scares me as an investor, especially for a company that's been around for so long, and is selling equipment in a subscription business. What are they spending all that money on? I'm not sure, and I'm worried about that. In the S-1, like many of these fast-revenue-growing companies that have been coming public recently, they're saying, \"We might not ever be profitable.\" As an investor, I don't like seeing those words. Yeah, it's a possibility, but I'd prefer a company that is actually making money.",
        "Flippen: I've clearly been looking at the wrong companies recently because that didn't bother me at all. I know about Peloton from, it has a really large social media following. Where I imagine a lot of those investments are going is building the brand, building the awareness. They've been extremely successful in that. SoulCycle is something that a few years ago got extremely popular. Peloton is playing off that same popularity, except giving it to you in your own home. SoulCycle itself expressed interest in potentially creating a home exercise bike similar to Peloton's. It'll be interesting to see if they see this market as lucrative enough to innovate and go after it themselves.",
        "Greer: You mentioned SoulCycle. For Peloton, is their primary competition essentially a gym membership or a membership to a place like SoulCycle? Or is their primary competition some other home fitness option?",
        "Flippen: My gut told me when I first started looking at this company that it was the high-end gym memberships, the SoulCycles, the classes of the world. If you can get access to these experts in the comfort of your own home, why wouldn't you do that? But if you actually read their S-1, they're going after a lower demographic, they said $50,000 was their minimum income. Then they're saying that they had the largest growth in people under 35 who made less than $75,000 a year. That makes me think that maybe they're actually competing with the lower-end gym memberships out there.",
        "Mueller: That worries me because then it becomes more like a commodity. Do they want to go down the commodity route of lower and lower prices? Yeah, $2,500 does seem to impose a fairly high switching cost once you've bought that bike. But if you can get the bike for $1,500 or $1,000 in a few years, or you can get a SoulCycle bike or a NordicTrack bike for the same thing, how much of that are they going to do? Or, is Peloton going to go high-end and try to stay at that exclusive lifestyle choice, \"Look at me, I'm a Peloton user and I've got the apparel to prove it,\" and all this other stuff? That might be a better route for the company to go down.",
        "Greer: Okay, a non-Peloton question, but on the subject of fitness. I can't touch my toes. I've never been able to come anywhere close to being able to touch my toes. Here's the question. I put it to colleagues recently. If I start stretching and I do all the right things, can I over time learn to touch my toes? Or is that largely genetic? Is the cake baked?",
        "Flippen: Do people actually think that they're genetically unable to touch their toes?",
        "Greer: Have you seen me try to touch my toes?",
        "Flippen: I think you can teach yourself if you try. Stretch every day. Do yoga. I don't do yoga myself. But I've anecdotally heard yoga is great for helping people relax their muscles to the extent where they can touch their toes.",
        "Greer: That would be amazing! That's going to be on my bucket list.",
        "Mueller: Mac, you invited the wrong people into the studio. You need Sam Whiteside in here. She's our fitness Fool here. She'd be able to answer your question.",
        "Greer: She put together a stretching routine for me. I even put it on my Outlook. It was so sad. This is what would happen if I did the whole Peloton thing. Every day, I would just look at this appointment for stretching to remind me to stretch and I would just delete or ignore. And I finally just took it off my Outlook because it was so sad. It was so sad.",
        "Flippen: That makes me sad, too, Mac.",
        "Greer: But it wasn't $2,000 plus a subscription.",
        "Mueller: We need to get you a Peloton. Then you're invested in it.",
        "Greer: That's the thing. To bring it back around, maybe once you've made that up-front investment, you are much more inclined to use it. Although, gym memberships, that doesn't always work.",
        "Mueller: Yeah. $39, is that the monthly price?",
        "Flippen: Yeah, $39 for Peloton.",
        "Mueller: That's certainly an expense, but it's easy to ignore that. But once you've spent that $2,500, you'd probably feel really bad --",
        "Flippen: I'd be on that bike every day.",
        "Mueller: At least for the first week.",
        "Flippen: Yeah, then I'd forget about it.",
        "Greer: [laughs] Let's wrap up with the desert island question. It's a little tricky because we have Altria and Philip Morris, who may end up merging. Right now, we'll treat them as the same company. And we've got KFC, which is part of Yum! Brands. And we've got the soon-to-IPO Peloton. If you had to own one of those for the next five years, which one would you go with?",
        "Flippen: I'm second-guessing our choice of stories today based off the stock selection. I think I have to go with Yum! Brands. Like I said, I'm a big fan of Taco Bell. They opened up a hotel, a resort. They've proven that Taco Bell is not a fast-food chain, it is a lifestyle brand. Maybe KFC can do the same.",
        "Mueller: I'm going to go with Yum China, actually.",
        "Greer: Nice!",
        "Mueller: That one's growing nicely. Yum! Brands, if I had to. Yum China if I had my druthers. I want to stay away from cigarettes and I don't think Peloton is going to do well.",
        "Flippen: I agree.",
        "Greer: Okay, well, Jim and Emily, thanks for joining me!",
        "Flippen: Thanks for having us!",
        "Mueller: Thanks, Mac!",

        "IKEA is such a major player worldwide that, even though we can't buy shares, it's still worth paying attention when the company invests heavily in a particular market. And that's exactly what it's doing now with smart home products.",
        "Did you know that IKEA is actually one of the largest privately held companies in the world? (A bit ironic, perhaps, since it's a quintessential brand for Scandinavia, famous for its socialist leanings.) IKEA is a massive global conglomerate with 423 stores across 52 countries in North America, Asia and Australia, in addition to Europe. In 2018, it brought in roughly $45 billion in revenues.",
        "And this month, IKEA announced \"the biggest new business we are establishing since the introduction of Children's IKEA.\"",
        "If this new venture compares to Children's IKEA, well, that's a pretty sizable department in a pretty sizable store. And this time, IKEA is investing in building out its lineup of \"Home Smart\" products.",
        "Below are just two examples of smart home products from its new SYMFONISK line. The lamp and shelf are both also \u00a0wireless speakers, which you control with an app on your smartphone.",
        "That might sound straightforward enough, and that's the intention: To be appealing, a smart home device has to offer ease and convenience.",
        "But these products are part of a much bigger trend, one that we certainly have our eye on at\u00a0 Growth Investor : the \"Internet of Things\" (IoT). Now that practically all of us have smartphones, tablets, or some kind of mobile device, they can be remote controls for almost anything. Companies like Amazon\u00a0 (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Google\u00a0 (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) - and now IKEA - see the chance to cash in. (And therefore, investors\u00a0 are also able to cash in on the trend with Internet of Things stocks.)",
        "Now, if you want to sell IoT products, they can't just sound \"sound cool\"\u2026they have to actually be useful. A smart refrigerator sounds fanciful, for example. But if you're away from home and aren't sure what you might need to pick up from the grocery store, being able to check that on your smartphone can save you a lot of trouble.",
        "IKEA, though, is keeping it pretty simple, which has always been its strength.",
        "Another example is their new \"smart blinds.\" They don't have cords, which are a big safety risk for many homes. And since you can control them from a distance, you can install them on windows you can't physically reach.",
        "IKEA also has a range of smart lightbulbs and other smart speakers, which it's slowly been building out since 2012. Now that the company can easily offer products that are compatible with\u00a0 Apple\u00a0 (NASDAQ: AAPL ) HomeKit, Amazon's Alexa, and Google Assistant - all the most popular voice-command tools - the sky is the limit.",
        "Now, for a company that's better known for \"assemble yourself\" furniture and Swedish meatballs, why would smart home devices be a priority?",
        "Well, the Internet of Things is the future. Smart doorbells, smart security cameras, and smart appliances are popping up everywhere. And the trend's just getting started:",
        "Navigant Research expects smart home products to yield $3.2 billion in global annual revenues in 2019. But in 2028, we're looking at\u00a0 $14.3 billion annually. In other words, smart home device sales are projected to grow nearly five times in just nine years!",
        "So, clearly, IKEA now wants its slice of that pie. And that's an easy goal for this retailer: IKEA had almost a billion customers in their stores last year - plus another 2.5 billion online visitors!",
        "One day, entire houses will be smart homes. And from there, we're looking at entire \"smart cities,\" with networks for lighting, parking, traffic and waste management, citizen engagement, safety and security - all of them communicating by internet.",
        "It'll be like how today, you can often get a smartphone app for your home security system and make sure everything's fine at home while you're at the beach\u2026but on a much bigger scale.",
        "As an investor, I think we ought to be looking at the\u00a0 5G wireless buildout \u00a0as the way to profit from all this.",
        "After all, current networks aren't quite fast and reliable enough to handle it\u2026not when applications like healthcare and utilities are thrown into the mix.",
        "And if one day, we want self-driving cars to transport us safely - free from road rage and human error - then we will need ultrafast 5G speeds to make that work.",
        "Essentially, whoever controls 5G is anticipated to control the internet several years from now. (Including this new Internet of Things.) So, the long-term investment potential in 5G stocks is huge.",
        "Instead of companies like IKEA or even Apple that\u00a0 need\u00a0 5G networks to sell the corresponding products\u2026",
        "I think more money can be made in the one company that's involved in the\u00a0 creation\u00a0 of 5G. That will be\u00a0 the stock that lets us cash in \u00a0on the whole meteoric rise of 5G.",
        "In\u00a0 Growth Investor , we own a little-known electronics company - that is helping some high-profile clients move to 5G. Its customers include the top 25 telecoms\u2026the top 25 tech companies\u2026and 78 of the Fortune 100 companies. I've got full details for subscribers in my\u00a0 #1 Investment for the Coming 5G Revolution \u00a0special report.",
        "Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system - with\u00a0 returns rivaling even Warren Buffett . In his latest feat, Louis discovered the\u00a0 \"Master Key\" \u00a0to profiting from the biggest tech revolution of this (or any) generation.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.
